    "# SIR Epidemic Model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The **SIR model** is a foundational compartmental model in epidemiology, first proposed by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927. It divides a population into three mutually exclusive compartments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **S (Susceptible)**: Individuals who can contract the disease\n",
    "- **I (Infected)**: Individuals who have the disease and can transmit it\n",
    "- **R (Recovered/Removed)**: Individuals who have recovered and are immune (or deceased)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The dynamics are governed by the following system of ordinary differential equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dS}{dt} = -\\beta S I$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dI}{dt} = \\beta S I - \\gamma I$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\gamma I$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\beta$ is the **transmission rate** (probability of disease transmission per contact)\n",
    "- $\\gamma$ is the **recovery rate** (inverse of the infectious period)\n",
    "- $S$, $I$, $R$ are fractions of the total population $N$ (i.e., $S + I + R = 1$)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Reproduction Number\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical quantity is the **basic reproduction number**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R_0 = \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This represents the average number of secondary infections produced by a single infected individual in a fully susceptible population.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If $R_0 > 1$: Epidemic outbreak occurs\n",
    "- If $R_0 < 1$: Disease dies out\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conservation Law\n",
    "\n",
    "The total population is conserved:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d}{dt}(S + I + R) = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This implies $S(t) + I(t) + R(t) = N$ for all time $t$."

    "\n",
    "### Final Size Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The final epidemic size $R_\\infty$ satisfies the transcendental equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R_\\infty = 1 - S_0 \\exp\\left(-R_0 R_\\infty\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be solved numerically to predict the total outbreak size without full simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase Plane Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The SIR model exhibits interesting phase plane dynamics. The infection grows only when:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dI}{dt} > 0 \\implies S > \\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta} = \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This defines the **epidemic threshold**: an outbreak occurs only if $S_0 > 1/R_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "This simulation demonstrates the classic epidemic dynamics of the SIR model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The susceptible population decreases monotonically\n",
    "2. The infected population rises to a peak then declines\n",
    "3. The recovered population increases as a sigmoid curve\n",
    "4. The epidemic naturally terminates due to depletion of susceptibles\n",
    "\n",
    "The model, despite its simplicity, captures essential features of epidemic spread and provides the foundation for more complex epidemiological models including SEIR, SEIRS, and age-structured variants."
