    "# Knot Invariants: A Computational Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction to Knot Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "**Knot theory** is a branch of topology that studies mathematical knots—embeddings of a circle $S^1$ into three-dimensional Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^3$ (or the 3-sphere $S^3$). Two knots are considered equivalent if one can be continuously deformed into the other without cutting or passing through itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Formal Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "A **knot** $K$ is a smooth embedding:\n",
    "$$K: S^1 \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{R}^3$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Two knots $K_1$ and $K_2$ are **ambient isotopic** (equivalent) if there exists a continuous family of homeomorphisms:\n",
    "$$h_t: \\mathbb{R}^3 \\to \\mathbb{R}^3, \\quad t \\in [0,1]$$\n",
    "such that $h_0 = \\text{id}$ and $h_1(K_1) = K_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Knot Diagrams and Reidemeister Moves\n",
    "\n",
    "A **knot diagram** is a projection of a knot onto a plane with crossing information preserved. At each crossing, we indicate which strand passes over and which passes under.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reidemeister's Theorem (1927):** Two knot diagrams represent equivalent knots if and only if they are related by a finite sequence of **Reidemeister moves**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Type I (Twist):** Adding or removing a simple twist\n",
    "- **Type II (Poke):** Adding or removing two crossings between two strands\n",
    "- **Type III (Slide):** Sliding a strand over or under a crossing\n",
    "\n",
    "This theorem is fundamental because it reduces the problem of knot equivalence to a combinatorial problem."

    "## 2. Knot Invariants\n",
    "\n",
    "A **knot invariant** is a quantity or algebraic structure associated with a knot that remains unchanged under ambient isotopy. If two knots have different invariants, they cannot be equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Crossing Number\n",
    "\n",
    "The **crossing number** $c(K)$ is the minimum number of crossings in any diagram of knot $K$:\n",
    "$$c(K) = \\min_{D \\sim K} |\\text{crossings}(D)|$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The **unknot** (trivial knot) has $c(K) = 0$, the **trefoil** has $c(K) = 3$, and the **figure-eight knot** has $c(K) = 4$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Writhe\n",
    "\n",
    "For an oriented knot diagram $D$, each crossing is assigned a **sign** $\\epsilon = \\pm 1$ based on the right-hand rule:\n",
    "- **Positive crossing (+1):** The overstrand crosses from left to right relative to the understrand\n",
    "- **Negative crossing (-1):** The overstrand crosses from right to left\n",
    "\n",
    "The **writhe** of a diagram is:\n",
    "$$w(D) = \\sum_{\\text{crossings}} \\epsilon_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The writhe is a diagram invariant, not a knot invariant (it changes under Type I Reidemeister moves).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Linking Number\n",
    "\n",
    "For a two-component link $L = K_1 \\cup K_2$, the **linking number** measures how many times the components wind around each other:\n",
    "$$\\text{lk}(K_1, K_2) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\text{crossings of } K_1 \\text{ and } K_2} \\epsilon_i$$\n",
    "\n",

    "## 3. The Jones Polynomial\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Jones polynomial** $V_K(t)$ is a powerful knot invariant discovered by Vaughan Jones in 1984, earning him the Fields Medal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Definition via the Bracket Polynomial\n",
    "\n",
    "We first define the **Kauffman bracket** $\\langle D \\rangle$, a polynomial in variable $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bracket Rules:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\langle \\bigcirc \\rangle = 1$ (for the unknot)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. $\\langle D \\sqcup \\bigcirc \\rangle = (-A^2 - A^{-2}) \\langle D \\rangle$ (adding a disjoint unknot)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Skein relation** at each crossing:\n",
    "$$\\langle D_+ \\rangle = A \\langle D_0 \\rangle + A^{-1} \\langle D_\\infty \\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $D_+$ is the diagram with a crossing, $D_0$ is the \"A-smoothing\" (horizontal splice), and $D_\\infty$ is the \"B-smoothing\" (vertical splice).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 From Bracket to Jones Polynomial\n",
    "\n",
    "The bracket polynomial is invariant under Type II and III Reidemeister moves but not Type I. To obtain a true knot invariant, we normalize:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_K(t) = (-A)^{-3w(D)} \\langle D \\rangle \\Big|_{A = t^{-1/4}}$$\n",
    "\n",

    "1. $V_{\\text{unknot}}(t) = 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. $V_{K^*}(t) = V_K(t^{-1})$ where $K^*$ is the mirror image\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For the trefoil: $V_{3_1}(t) = t + t^3 - t^4$\n",

    "### 4.1 Knot Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "A knot diagram can be encoded as follows:\n",
    "- Number the crossings $1, 2, \\ldots, n$\n",
    "- Record the sequence of crossings encountered while traversing the knot\n",

    "An important question in knot theory: **How powerful are these invariants at distinguishing knots?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Alexander polynomial** cannot distinguish mirror images (chiral pairs)\n",
    "   - $\\Delta_{3_1}(t) = \\Delta_{3_1^*}(t)$ where $3_1^*$ is the mirror trefoil\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Jones polynomial** CAN distinguish some chiral pairs\n",
    "   - $V_{3_1}(t) \\neq V_{3_1^*}(t)$\n",
    "   - In fact: $V_{K^*}(t) = V_K(t^{-1})$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Neither polynomial is complete** - different knots can have the same invariants\n",
    "   - Example: The Kinoshita-Terasaka knot and Conway knot have the same Jones polynomial\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The figure-eight knot is amphichiral**\n",
    "   - $4_1 = 4_1^*$ (equivalent to its mirror image)\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Does $V_K(t) = 1$ imply $K$ is the unknot?** (Unknown!)\n",
