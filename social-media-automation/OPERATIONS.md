## System Overview

### Content Sources

1. **LaTeX Templates** (201 templates across 66 categories)
   - Location: `/home/user/latex-templates/templates/`
   - Scanned by: `template_scanner.py`
   - Content generated by: `content_generator.py`
   - Media extracted by: `media_extractor.py`

2. **Computational Notebooks** (253 notebooks, 7 with pre-written posts)
   - Location: `/home/user/computational-pipeline/social-media-automation/repo-data/notebooks/published/`
   - Posts location: `/home/user/computational-pipeline/social-media-automation/repo-data/output/social_posts/`
   - Scanned by: `notebook_scanner.py`
   - Posts parsed by: `post_text_parser.py`
   - Media extracted by: `notebook_content_extractor.py`

### Target Pages

1. **CoCalc Page** (ID: 698630966948910)
   - Receives: ALL content (templates + notebooks)
   - Focus: Broad computational science audience

2. **SageMath Page** (ID: 26593144945)
   - Receives: SageMath-relevant content only
   - Focus: Pure mathematics and symbolic computation

### Posting Strategy

- **Frequency**: 2 posts/day per page (1 template + 1 notebook)
- **Total**: Up to 4 posts/day across both pages
- **Duplicate Handling**: Content posted to both pages is spread across different days (minimum 2-day gap)
- **Content Mix**: 50% templates, 50% notebooks per page

## Quick Start

### Generate Weekly Schedule

```bash
cd /home/user/computational-pipeline/social-media-automation
python3 enhanced_scheduler.py
```

This generates a week of mixed content, creates the queue, and shows statistics.
