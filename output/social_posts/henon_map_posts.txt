Just simulated the Hénon Map—a deceptively simple system that produces infinite fractal complexity!

xₙ₊₁ = 1 - axₙ² + yₙ
yₙ₊₁ = bxₙ

Lyapunov exponent λ ≈ 0.42 confirms chaos.

Explored the Hénon Map: a 2D discrete dynamical system that generates strange attractors from just two simple equations.

The positive Lyapunov exponent (λ ≈ 0.42) mathematically confirms chaotic behavior—tiny changes lead to wildly different outcomes.

Ever wonder how chaos emerges from simplicity?

The Hénon Map is just two equations:
xₙ₊₁ = 1 - axₙ² + yₙ
yₙ₊₁ = bxₙ

Yet iterate them 100,000 times and you get a beautiful strange attractor with fractal structure—infinite detail at every scale!

The math behind it: the Jacobian determinant is -b, making the system dissipative (it contracts space). Combined with nonlinearity, this creates chaos.

Fractal dimension ≈ 1.261. Order from chaos, literally.

Implemented the Hénon Map—Michel Hénon's 1976 simplification of the Lorenz system's Poincaré section.

Equations:
xₙ₊₁ = 1 - axₙ² + yₙ
yₙ₊₁ = bxₙ

With classical parameters (a=1.4, b=0.3):
• Largest Lyapunov exponent λ ≈ 0.42 (chaos confirmed)
• Hausdorff dimension ≈ 1.261
• det(J) = -b ensures dissipation

The bifurcation diagram shows period-doubling cascade to chaos—a universal route in nonlinear dynamics.

**Title:** I simulated the Hénon Map in Python—here's how 2 simple equations create infinite fractal complexity

**Body:**

I've been exploring chaotic dynamical systems and just finished implementing the Hénon Map, one of the most studied examples of discrete-time chaos.

**What is it?**

The Hénon Map is incredibly simple—just two equations:
- xₙ₊₁ = 1 - a·xₙ² + yₙ
- yₙ₊₁ = b·xₙ

That's it. But when you iterate these equations thousands of times with the right parameters (a=1.4, b=0.3), you get a "strange attractor"—a fractal structure with infinite self-similar detail.

**The cool math (ELI5 version):**

The Jacobian determinant equals -b, which means every iteration, the system "contracts" space by a factor of 0.3. This dissipation forces all trajectories to collapse onto the attractor. But the nonlinearity (that x² term) stretches and folds space, creating the fractal complexity.

**What I learned:**

1. Computed the largest Lyapunov exponent (λ ≈ 0.42)—this positive value mathematically proves the system is chaotic
2. The attractor has a Hausdorff dimension of about 1.261 (between a line and a plane!)
3. The bifurcation diagram shows "period-doubling"—a universal route to chaos seen in everything from dripping faucets to population dynamics

Can two simple equations create infinite complexity? Yes!

The Hénon Map takes just:
xₙ₊₁ = 1 - axₙ² + yₙ
yₙ₊₁ = bxₙ

Run it 100,000 times and you get a "strange attractor"—a beautiful fractal pattern that never repeats but stays bounded in space.

This is deterministic chaos: completely predictable equations producing unpredictable behavior. Tiny changes in starting conditions lead to completely different paths.

Exploring Chaos Theory Through Computational Methods: The Hénon Map

Just completed a computational analysis of the Hénon Map—a foundational discrete-time dynamical system in chaos theory research.

**Technical Approach:**

Implemented the two-dimensional iterated map:
• xₙ₊₁ = 1 - axₙ² + yₙ
• yₙ₊₁ = bxₙ

With classical parameters (a=1.4, b=0.3), generated 100,000 iterations to visualize the strange attractor.

**Key Results:**
• Computed largest Lyapunov exponent (λ ≈ 0.42), confirming chaotic dynamics
• Visualized fractal self-similarity through zoomed attractor regions
• Generated bifurcation diagram showing period-doubling cascade to chaos

**Skills Applied:**
- Numerical computation (NumPy)
- Scientific visualization (Matplotlib)
- Dynamical systems analysis
- Eigenvalue computation for stability analysis

The Hénon Map remains a standard testbed for studying control methods, synchronization, and prediction in chaotic systems—with applications from climate modeling to cryptography.

Chaos in two equations ✨

The Hénon Map:
xₙ₊₁ = 1 - axₙ² + yₙ
yₙ₊₁ = bxₙ

100,000 iterations → this stunning fractal attractor

Zoom in anywhere and you'll find infinite self-similar structure. That's the magic of strange attractors.

The math proves it's chaotic: Lyapunov exponent λ ≈ 0.42 (positive = chaos)

Michel Hénon created this in 1976 as a simplified model of the Lorenz system. Simple rules, complex beauty.
