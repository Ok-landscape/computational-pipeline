Why can't you beat a fair casino? Martingales explain it mathematically.

E[X_{n+1} | info] = X_n

Your best prediction of tomorrow = today's value. The house always wins.

Simulated 1000 random walks to prove it.

Martingales: the mathematical reason no betting strategy beats a fair game.

The martingale property states E[X_{n+1} | F_n] = X_n — your best forecast of the future is the present.

Simulated random walks and exponential martingales in Python to verify the theory holds.

Ever wonder why the "double your bet" strategy doesn't actually work?

Martingales explain it. A martingale is a sequence where your best prediction of tomorrow is today's value: E[X_{n+1} | past] = X_n

I simulated 1000 random walk paths in Python. The mean stays at zero forever — no matter how long you play.

Doob's Optional Stopping Theorem proves you can't beat a fair game with ANY strategy. Math doesn't lie.

Implemented martingale simulations in Python.

A martingale satisfies E[X_{n+1} | F_n] = X_n (conditional expectation equals current value).

Key results verified:
• Simple random walk: E[S_n] ≈ 0 across 1000 paths
• Exponential martingale M_n = exp(θS_n - nψ(θ)) maintains E[M_n] = 1
• Optional Stopping Theorem: E[S_τ] = 0 for bounded stopping times

The math behind why gambling strategies fail — and why risk-neutral pricing works in finance.

**Title:** I simulated martingales in Python to understand why you can't beat a fair casino

**Body:**

Ever heard of the "martingale betting strategy" where you double your bet after each loss? Mathematically, it's doomed to fail — and the reason is the martingale property itself.

**What's a martingale?**

A martingale is a sequence of random variables where your best prediction of the next value, given everything you know, is just the current value:

E[X_{n+1} | current info] = X_n

Think of it as a "fair game" — on average, you neither gain nor lose.

**What I simulated:**

1. **Simple random walk** — flip a coin, go up 1 or down 1. After 1000 paths of 500 steps each, the mean stays pinned near zero.

2. **Exponential martingale** — M_n = exp(θ·S_n - n·log(cosh(θ))). Despite wild individual paths, the expected value stays at 1.

3. **Optional Stopping Theorem** — stopped the walk at boundaries ±10. With 10,000 simulations, E[S_τ] ≈ 0 (theory says exactly 0).

**Why it matters:**

- Gambling: No strategy beats a fair game (Doob's theorem)
- Finance: Discounted stock prices are martingales under risk-neutral measure → foundation of Black-Scholes
- Statistics: Sequential testing and confidence sequences

The code uses NumPy and Matplotlib, runs in seconds, and the plots show the theory beautifully.

Why can't you beat a fair casino? Mathematics has the answer: martingales.

A martingale is a "fair game" where your best guess of what comes next is simply where you are now. No matter how clever your betting strategy, the expected outcome is... zero.

I ran 10,000 simulations in Python. The math checks out perfectly.

This same concept is the foundation of modern stock option pricing!

Exploring Martingales: The Mathematical Foundation of Fair Games and Financial Pricing

I recently developed a computational notebook exploring martingale theory — a cornerstone of probability, stochastic processes, and quantitative finance.

Key concepts implemented:

• Martingale property: E[X_{n+1} | F_n] = X_n
• Simple random walk as a discrete martingale
• Exponential martingales: M_n = exp(θS_n - nψ(θ))
• Doob's Optional Stopping Theorem verification

Technical approach:
- Simulated 1,000 paths × 500 time steps
- Verified constant expected values empirically
- Demonstrated the Optional Stopping Theorem with 10,000 boundary-hitting simulations
- Visualized convergence to theoretical distributions via CLT

Applications in industry:
- Risk-neutral pricing in derivatives markets
- No-arbitrage theory (fundamental theorem of asset pricing)
- Sequential statistical testing

Tools: Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib

The intersection of rigorous mathematics and computational verification continues to be a powerful approach for building intuition around abstract concepts.

Why you can't beat a fair casino — explained with math and code

A martingale is a "fair game" where the best prediction of tomorrow is today.

E[next] = now

I simulated 1000 random walks in Python.
The average? Stays at zero. Forever.

No betting strategy can change this.
Doob's theorem proves it mathematically.

This same concept prices stock options on Wall Street.
