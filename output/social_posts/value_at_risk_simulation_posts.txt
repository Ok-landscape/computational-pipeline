How much could you lose tomorrow? Value at Risk (VaR) quantifies your worst-case portfolio loss at 95% or 99% confidence.

Built a Monte Carlo simulation comparing 3 VaR methods on a $1M portfolio.

Value at Risk (VaR) answers: "What's the maximum I could lose with 95% confidence?"

Implemented three VaR calculation methods:
- Parametric (normal distribution)
- Historical simulation
- Monte Carlo (100K scenarios)

Plus Expected Shortfall for tail risk. Full Python notebook available.

Ever wonder how banks measure risk? They use Value at Risk (VaR).

VaR tells you the worst-case loss you might face on a given day with a certain probability. Think: "There's only a 5% chance I'll lose more than $X."

I built a Python simulation comparing three VaR methods on a $1M portfolio:
- Parametric: assumes returns are normally distributed
- Historical: uses actual past returns
- Monte Carlo: simulates 100,000 possible futures

The 95% VaR came out around $19K - the max daily loss you'd expect 95% of the time.

Implemented Value at Risk (VaR) using three methods in Python:

1. Parametric: VaR = -(μ + z_α × σ)
   Uses normal distribution assumption

2. Historical: Empirical percentile of past returns

3. Monte Carlo: Simulate N scenarios, take percentile

Key insight: VaR only shows the threshold, not tail magnitude. Expected Shortfall (CVaR) captures what happens BEYOND VaR:

ES_α = E[Loss | Loss > VaR]

For a $1M portfolio with 20% annual vol, 99% VaR ≈ $29K vs ES ≈ $33K.

**Title:** Built a Value at Risk (VaR) Monte Carlo Simulation in Python - Comparing 3 Risk Calculation Methods

**Body:**

I created a Jupyter notebook exploring Value at Risk (VaR), the standard risk metric used by banks and investment firms to measure potential portfolio losses.

**What is VaR?**

VaR answers: "What's the maximum amount I could lose over one day, with 95% (or 99%) confidence?"

For example, if your 95% daily VaR is $19,000, that means on 95% of days, your losses won't exceed $19K. But on that remaining 5% of days... it could be worse.

**The Three Methods I Implemented:**

1. **Parametric VaR** - Assumes returns follow a normal (Gaussian) distribution. Simple formula: VaR = -(μ + z × σ), where z is the standard normal quantile.

2. **Historical Simulation** - No assumptions! Just take the 5th percentile (for 95% VaR) of your actual historical returns.

3. **Monte Carlo Simulation** - Generate thousands of random scenarios based on estimated mean and volatility, then find the percentile.

**Results for a $1M Portfolio (20% annual volatility):**

| Confidence | Parametric | Historical | Monte Carlo |
|------------|------------|------------|-------------|
| 95%        | $19,214    | $19,041    | ~$19,200    |
| 99%        | $28,073    | $29,118    | ~$28,500    |

**The Big Insight: VaR's Limitation**

VaR only tells you the threshold - not how bad things get beyond it. That's why I also calculated Expected Shortfall (ES), which averages the losses in the worst 5% (or 1%) of cases.

At 99% confidence, ES is about 15% higher than VaR, showing there's significant tail risk VaR doesn't capture. This is why regulators moved to ES after 2008.

How do banks know if they have enough money to survive a bad day?

They use Value at Risk (VaR) - a measure that says "We're 95% confident our losses won't exceed $X."

I built a simulation comparing three ways to calculate VaR for a hypothetical $1M investment portfolio. The coolest part? Monte Carlo simulation generates 100,000 possible "futures" to estimate risk.

Result: 95% daily VaR ≈ $19,000

Value at Risk (VaR) remains the cornerstone of financial risk management, despite its limitations exposed during 2008.

I developed a Python notebook implementing three VaR methodologies:

**Parametric Method**
Efficient but assumes normal distribution, potentially underestimating tail risk.

**Historical Simulation**
Distribution-free but constrained by available data.

**Monte Carlo Simulation**
Most flexible for complex instruments; ran 100,000 scenarios.

**Key Technical Findings:**

For a $1M portfolio with 20% annualized volatility:
- 95% VaR: ~$19,200 (daily)
- 99% VaR: ~$28,500 (daily)
- 99% Expected Shortfall: ~$33,000

The gap between VaR and Expected Shortfall illustrates why Basel III regulations shifted toward ES as the primary market risk measure - it's a coherent risk measure that properly captures tail risk.

**Skills demonstrated:** Monte Carlo simulation, statistical modeling, risk quantification, financial mathematics

How much could you lose tomorrow?

Value at Risk (VaR) is how Wall Street answers that question.

This visualization shows a Monte Carlo simulation of 100,000 possible portfolio outcomes.

The red zone? That's the worst 5% - losses beyond the 95% VaR threshold.

For a $1M portfolio:
→ 95% VaR = $19K
→ 99% VaR = $29K

Translation: On 95% of days, you won't lose more than $19K.

But VaR has a flaw - it doesn't tell you HOW BAD that other 5% can get.

That's where Expected Shortfall comes in.
