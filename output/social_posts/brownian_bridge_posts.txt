Brownian bridges: random walks forced to return home.

The variance t(T-t)/T peaks at the midpoint - maximum uncertainty when you're furthest from the boundaries.

Simulated 10,000 paths to verify. Beautiful math.

Explored Brownian bridges today - a Wiener process conditioned to return to zero at time T.

Key insight: Variance = t(T-t)/T, maximized at t=T/2.

Built simulations confirming theoretical properties: boundary conditions, covariance structure, Gaussian distribution.

Ever wondered what happens when you force a random walk to come back to where it started?

That's a Brownian bridge! It's Brownian motion conditioned on B(0) = B(T) = 0.

The cool part: uncertainty is highest in the middle (variance = t(T-t)/T). Near the boundaries, the process is constrained to be close to zero.

I simulated 10,000 paths and verified the theoretical properties - mean, variance, covariance, normality. Math checks out perfectly.

Implemented and verified Brownian bridge simulations in Python.

The Brownian bridge B(t) = W(t) - (t/T)W(T) has elegant properties:
- E[B(t)] = 0
- Var(B(t)) = t(T-t)/T
- Cov(B(s),B(t)) = s(1-t/T) for s ≤ t

Verified with 10,000 Monte Carlo paths:
- Boundary conditions: exact (B(0)=B(T)=0)
- Variance at T/2: 0.2499 vs theoretical 0.25 (<1% error)
- Shapiro-Wilk confirms Gaussianity

Applications span KS statistics, finance (variance reduction), and polymer physics.

**Title:** Simulating Brownian Bridges in Python - When Random Walks Must Return Home

**Body:**

Ever heard of a Brownian bridge? It's one of those elegant mathematical objects that sounds fancy but has a simple intuition.

**ELI5:** Imagine you're a drunk person doing a random walk, but you MUST end up exactly where you started. How does that constraint change your journey? That's the Brownian bridge.

**The Math (in plain terms):**
- Regular Brownian motion W(t) can wander anywhere
- A Brownian bridge B(t) is conditioned to return to zero: B(0) = B(T) = 0
- Formula: B(t) = W(t) - (t/T) × W(T)

**Interesting Properties:**
1. The mean is always zero
2. Variance = t(T-t)/T - it's a parabola! Maximum uncertainty at the midpoint
3. The process is Gaussian at every time point

**What I Built:**
- Simulated 10,000 sample paths
- Verified boundary conditions (exact to machine precision)
- Confirmed variance formula (<1% error)
- Ran Shapiro-Wilk normality test (passed)

**Why It Matters:**
- Statistics: The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test uses Brownian bridge properties
- Finance: Variance reduction in Monte Carlo pricing
- Physics: Modeling constrained polymer chains

The code uses numpy for simulation and scipy for statistical tests. Each path is generated by first simulating standard Brownian motion, then applying the bridge transformation.

Just finished exploring one of my favorite mathematical objects: the Brownian bridge.

Imagine a random walk that MUST return to its starting point. How does it behave? Turns out the uncertainty is highest in the middle of the journey - when you're furthest from the constraints.

I simulated 10,000 random paths and verified the math. The theory matches perfectly with computation.

This has real applications in statistics, finance, and even physics!

Computational Verification of Brownian Bridge Properties

Today I completed a comprehensive simulation study of Brownian bridges - a fundamental stochastic process with applications across quantitative finance, statistical testing, and physics.

Key methodology:
- Implemented direct construction: B(t) = W(t) - (t/T)W(T)
- Generated 10,000 Monte Carlo sample paths
- Verified theoretical properties against empirical estimates

Results:
- Boundary conditions: B(0) = B(T) = 0 (exact to machine precision)
- Variance at midpoint: 0.2499 empirical vs 0.25 theoretical (<1% relative error)
- Covariance structure: Confirmed Cov(B(s),B(t)) = s(1-t/T)
- Shapiro-Wilk test: Confirms Gaussian marginal distributions

This work demonstrates the importance of computational validation in stochastic analysis. The Brownian bridge appears in the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, variance reduction techniques for Monte Carlo simulation, and models of constrained physical systems.

Tools: Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib

Brownian Bridges: Random Walks That Come Home

This visualization shows 20 sample paths of a Brownian bridge - random motion constrained to start and end at zero.

The red shaded region? That's the theoretical uncertainty envelope.

Notice how paths spread out in the middle but are forced together at the boundaries.

Variance formula: t(T-t)/T
Maximum uncertainty: exactly at the midpoint

10,000 simulated paths confirm the math.

Beautiful when theory meets computation.
