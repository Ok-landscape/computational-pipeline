Why can't interest rates go negative? The CIR model explains it with one elegant equation:

dr = κ(θ - r)dt + σ√r dW

The √r term is the magic—volatility shrinks as rates approach zero.

Implemented the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross interest rate model in Python. Key insight: the √r volatility term ensures rates stay non-negative when 2κθ ≥ σ² (Feller condition). Monte Carlo simulations confirm convergence to a Gamma stationary distribution.

Ever wonder how banks model interest rates?

The CIR model uses mean reversion: rates drift toward a long-term average θ.

The equation: dr = κ(θ - r)dt + σ√r dW

What makes it special:
• κ controls how fast rates snap back
• The √r term prevents negative rates
• Must satisfy 2κθ ≥ σ² (Feller condition)

Coded it in Python with exact simulation using non-central chi-squared sampling. The terminal distribution converges to a Gamma distribution!

New notebook: Cox-Ingersoll-Ross interest rate model

The SDE: dr = κ(θ - r)dt + σ√r dW

Implemented two simulation methods:
1. Euler-Maruyama with reflection at zero
2. Exact sampling via non-central χ² distribution

Key math:
• Conditional mean: E[r_{t+Δt}|r_t] = r_t·e^{-κΔt} + θ(1 - e^{-κΔt})
• Stationary dist: Gamma(2κθ/σ², σ²/2κ)

The Feller condition 2κθ ≥ σ² ensures non-negativity.

**Title:** I implemented the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross interest rate model in Python with exact simulation—here's what I learned

**Body:**

The Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model is one of the most important models in quantitative finance for describing how interest rates evolve over time.

**ELI5 Version:**

Imagine interest rates are like a dog on a leash. The leash has a "home position" (the long-term mean θ). If rates wander too far from home, they get pulled back—this is mean reversion. The parameter κ controls how strong the leash is.

But here's the clever bit: the model ensures rates can never go negative. How? The volatility (randomness) is proportional to √r. As rates approach zero, the randomness shrinks, preventing them from going negative.

**The Math (Unicode version):**

The model follows this stochastic differential equation:

dr = κ(θ - r)dt + σ√r dW

Where:
- κ = speed of mean reversion
- θ = long-term mean rate
- σ = volatility
- W = Brownian motion

**What I Implemented:**

1. **Euler-Maruyama simulation** - Simple but can produce negative values (needs reflection fix)
2. **Exact simulation** - Uses non-central chi-squared distribution, no discretization error

**Key Insight:**

The Feller condition (2κθ ≥ σ²) must be satisfied for rates to stay strictly positive. In my simulation with κ=0.5, θ=5%, σ=0.1:

2 × 0.5 × 0.05 = 0.05 ≥ 0.01 = σ² ✓

**Results:**

Monte Carlo with 1000 paths showed the terminal distribution converges to the theoretical Gamma distribution. The sample mean matched the theoretical mean θ = 5% closely.

How do banks predict where interest rates are headed?

One key model: Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (1985)

The beautiful thing? It's built on a simple principle—rates naturally drift back toward a long-term average, but with randomness that shrinks as rates approach zero. This means the model can't produce impossible negative rates.

I coded it in Python and ran 1000 simulations. The results match the theory perfectly—rates converge to a 5% equilibrium.

Excited to share my latest quantitative finance project: a complete Python implementation of the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) interest rate model.

**Why This Matters:**

The CIR model is foundational in fixed-income analysis, derivative pricing, and risk management. It describes interest rate dynamics through a mean-reverting stochastic process that guarantees non-negative rates—a critical property for realistic modeling.

**Technical Implementation:**

• Implemented both Euler-Maruyama and exact simulation methods
• The exact method uses non-central chi-squared sampling for zero discretization error
• Validated theoretical moments against Monte Carlo simulation (1000 paths)
• Conducted parameter sensitivity analysis for κ, θ, and σ

**Key Mathematical Properties:**

The model satisfies the Feller condition (2κθ ≥ σ²) and converges to a Gamma stationary distribution. The conditional expectation decays exponentially toward the long-term mean.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

Stochastic calculus, Monte Carlo methods, SciPy statistical distributions, financial modeling, data visualization

Interest rates can't go negative... but why?

The Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model explains it beautifully.

The secret: volatility scales with √r
→ As rates drop toward zero
→ Randomness shrinks
→ Rates bounce back up

This 1985 model is still used today in:
• Bond pricing
• Options on interest rates
• Credit risk modeling

Swipe to see how 1000 simulated rate paths all converge to the same 5% equilibrium.

The math is elegant.
The code is Python.
The results are satisfying.
