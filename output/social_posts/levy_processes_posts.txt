Lévy processes: the "wild" cousins of Brownian motion.

When α < 2, variance becomes infinite. Smaller α = heavier tails = bigger jumps.

Key insight: self-similarity with index H = 1/α

Explored Lévy processes today - stochastic processes with stationary independent increments.

The stability index α controls tail heaviness:
- α = 2: Brownian motion (Gaussian)
- α = 1: Cauchy process (infinite mean!)
- α < 2: infinite variance

Self-similar with H = 1/α

Just built a simulation of α-stable Lévy processes and the results are fascinating.

These processes generalize Brownian motion but with a twist: as you decrease α below 2, the tails get heavier and jumps get wilder.

At α = 1 (Cauchy process), even the mean doesn't exist! At α = 0.5, you get extreme jumps.

The cool part: they're self-similar. Zoom in or out and statistically they look the same, scaled by c^(1/α).

Used in finance, physics, and modeling rare events.

Implemented α-stable Lévy process simulations using the Chambers-Mallows-Stuck algorithm.

Key mathematical structure:
- Lévy-Khintchine formula gives characteristic exponent ψ(θ)
- Triplet (γ, σ², ν) uniquely determines the process
- Self-similarity: X_{ct} =^d c^(1/α) X_t

Findings:
- α = 2 → Gaussian (finite variance)
- α < 2 → power-law tails: P(|X| > x) ~ x^(-α)
- α ≤ 1 → infinite mean

Applications: jump-diffusion models in finance, anomalous diffusion in physics.

Title: I built a simulation of Lévy processes - here's what I learned about "wild" randomness

Body:

**TL;DR:** Lévy processes generalize Brownian motion to allow for jumps and heavy tails. I simulated α-stable processes and visualized how the stability index α controls the "wildness" of the paths.

---

**What are Lévy processes?**

A stochastic process with:
1. X₀ = 0
2. Independent increments
3. Stationary increments
4. Stochastic continuity

Brownian motion and Poisson processes are both special cases!

**The key parameter: α (stability index)**

- α = 2: You get standard Brownian motion (Gaussian)
- α = 1.5: Heavy tails, infinite variance
- α = 1.0: Cauchy process - even the mean is undefined!
- α = 0.5: Extremely heavy tails with dramatic jumps

**Cool findings:**

1. **Heavy tails follow power laws:** P(|X| > x) ~ x^(-α)

2. **Self-similarity:** These processes look statistically identical at any time scale when rescaled by c^(1/α)

3. **Jump structure:** Smaller α means more frequent large jumps. The Lévy measure ν(dx) ~ |x|^(-1-α) dx controls this.

**The simulation method:**

Used the Chambers-Mallows-Stuck algorithm to generate stable random variables, then constructed paths via cumulative sums with proper time scaling.

**Why it matters:**

Lévy processes are used in mathematical finance (modeling asset price jumps), physics (anomalous diffusion), and anywhere extreme events matter.

Ever wondered what happens when random walks get "wild"?

I explored Lévy processes - a beautiful class of random processes that include Brownian motion but go much further.

The stability index α controls how extreme the jumps can be. At α = 2, you get gentle Gaussian behavior. Drop to α = 1 and the average doesn't even exist mathematically!

These models help explain rare extreme events in finance, physics, and nature.

Exploring Lévy Processes: When Gaussian Isn't Enough

In quantitative finance and risk modeling, we often need to account for rare but extreme events that Gaussian models miss. Enter Lévy processes.

Key technical insights from my simulation study:

- The Lévy-Khintchine formula provides a complete characterization through the triplet (γ, σ², ν) - drift, diffusion, and jump measure

- α-stable processes with α < 2 exhibit infinite variance, crucial for modeling fat-tailed returns

- Self-similarity property (H = 1/α) enables multi-scale analysis

- Implemented Chambers-Mallows-Stuck algorithm for efficient stable distribution sampling

Practical applications:
- Jump-diffusion models for derivative pricing
- Heavy-tailed risk measures (VaR, CVaR)
- Anomalous diffusion in physical systems

The methodology demonstrates proficiency in stochastic simulation, numerical methods, and Python scientific computing (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib).

The math of extreme events

These four plots show α-stable Lévy processes with different stability indices.

α = 2: Smooth Brownian motion
α = 1.5: Occasional big jumps
α = 1.0: Cauchy process - mean undefined!
α = 0.5: Wild jumps everywhere

Lower α = heavier tails = more extreme behavior

Used in modeling stock market crashes, earthquake magnitudes, and animal foraging patterns.

Self-similar: zoom in or out and they look statistically identical
