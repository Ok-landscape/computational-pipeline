Why can't you flatten a map without distortion?

Gaussian curvature: K = κ₁ · κ₂

Spheres (K > 0) can't become planes (K = 0) without tearing.

Gauss proved this in 1827 - still blowing minds today.

Exploring Gaussian Curvature with Python

The Theorema Egregium proves that K = κ₁·κ₂ is intrinsic - it depends only on measurements within the surface itself.

This explains why every world map has distortions: you cannot bend a sphere (K > 0) into a plane (K = 0) without stretching.

Did you know there's a mathematical reason why every map of Earth is distorted?

Gaussian curvature (K) measures how "curved" a surface is:
• Sphere: K > 0 (positive, dome-like)
• Saddle: K < 0 (negative, Pringles chip)
• Plane: K = 0 (flat)

Gauss's "Theorema Egregium" (1827) proves K is intrinsic - you literally cannot bend a sphere into a flat map without tearing or stretching it.

I visualized this with Python, computing K for spheres, saddles, and tori. Math is beautiful!

Implemented numerical computation of Gaussian curvature in Python.

K = (LN - M²) / (EG - F²)

where E, F, G are first fundamental form coefficients and L, M, N are second fundamental form coefficients.

Key insight: For a torus, K > 0 on the outer rim, K < 0 on the inner rim, and K = 0 at top/bottom.

The Theorema Egregium shows K is an intrinsic invariant - isometric deformations preserve curvature. This is why cartographers cannot make a perfect flat map of Earth.

Title: I computed Gaussian Curvature for spheres, saddles, and tori in Python - here's why every map of Earth is wrong

Body:

**ELI5 version:** Imagine wrapping a gift. You can wrap a cylinder (like a tube) with flat paper - just roll it up. But try wrapping a ball perfectly with flat paper and you'll get creases or have to tear it. That's Gaussian curvature at work!

**The math:** Gaussian curvature K = κ₁ · κ₂, where κ₁ and κ₂ are the maximum and minimum "bendiness" at any point.

- Sphere: K = 1/R² (always positive, bends the same way in all directions)
- Saddle: K < 0 (bends up in one direction, down in another - think Pringles)
- Plane: K = 0 (no bending)

**Why it matters:** Gauss proved the "Theorema Egregium" (Remarkable Theorem) in 1827: you cannot change a surface's Gaussian curvature without stretching or tearing. A sphere has K > 0, a plane has K = 0, so there's no perfect flat map of Earth. Every projection (Mercator, Robinson, etc.) introduces distortion.

**What I built:** Used NumPy to compute K numerically using the first and second fundamental forms:

K = (LN - M²) / (EG - F²)

Visualized three surfaces:
1. Sphere - constant positive curvature
2. Hyperbolic paraboloid (saddle) - negative curvature everywhere
3. Torus - K varies! Positive on outer rim, negative on inner rim, zero at top/bottom

**Cool applications:**
- General Relativity uses this concept for spacetime curvature
- Computer graphics uses curvature for mesh analysis
- Material science studies stress in curved shells

Ever wonder why every map of Earth looks different and they're ALL slightly wrong?

The answer is Gaussian curvature - a mathematical property that Gauss discovered in 1827.

Spheres have positive curvature. Flat surfaces have zero curvature. And you simply CANNOT transform one into the other without stretching or tearing!

I visualized this concept using Python, computing curvature for spheres, saddles, and donuts (tori). The math behind why we can't have a perfect world map is beautiful.

Exploring Differential Geometry Through Computational Methods

I recently built a Python implementation to numerically compute Gaussian curvature - a fundamental concept from differential geometry with applications in physics, computer graphics, and material science.

Key technical components:
- Implemented finite difference methods for computing partial derivatives on parametric surfaces
- Calculated first and second fundamental form coefficients (E, F, G and L, M, N)
- Applied the curvature formula: K = (LN - M²) / (EG - F²)

The project visualizes three classical surfaces:
1. Sphere - constant positive curvature (K = 1/R²)
2. Hyperbolic paraboloid - negative curvature throughout
3. Torus - variable curvature (positive on outer rim, negative on inner)

The Theorema Egregium demonstrates that Gaussian curvature is an intrinsic invariant - it's preserved under isometric deformations. This has profound implications from map projections to Einstein's general relativity.

Skills demonstrated: NumPy, Matplotlib, numerical methods, 3D visualization, mathematical modeling.

Gaussian Curvature: Why Math Says Perfect Maps Are Impossible

Swipe to see:
• A sphere (always curves the same way)
• A saddle (curves up AND down)
• A donut/torus (both kinds of curvature!)

The color shows curvature:
Red = positive (dome-like)
Blue = negative (saddle-like)

Fun fact: Gauss proved in 1827 that you can't flatten a sphere without distortion.

That's why every world map lies to you a little bit.

Built with Python + Matplotlib.
