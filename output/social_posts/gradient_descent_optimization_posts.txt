Ever wonder how AI learns? It's all gradient descent!

The magic formula: x(k+1) = x(k) - α∇f(x)

Just follow the slope downhill until you find the minimum.

Gradient descent is the backbone of machine learning. The update rule is elegantly simple:

x(k+1) = x(k) - α∇f(x(k))

We move opposite to the gradient (steepest ascent direction) to find minimums.

Learning rate α is critical—too large causes oscillation, too small is slow.

Let's talk about gradient descent—the algorithm that powers basically all of modern AI.

The idea is beautifully simple: to find the minimum of a function, just walk downhill. The gradient ∇f tells you which way is "up," so go the opposite direction.

The update: x(k+1) = x(k) - α∇f(x(k))

Here's the catch: choosing the learning rate α is an art. Too big and you'll overshoot. Too small and you'll be waiting forever.

Adding momentum (β) helps speed things up in narrow valleys!

Implemented gradient descent optimization from scratch in Python.

Key findings:

Standard GD update: x(k+1) = x(k) - α∇f(x(k))

With momentum: v(k+1) = βv(k) + ∇f(x(k)), then x(k+1) = x(k) - αv(k+1)

Tested on Rosenbrock function f(x,y) = (1-x)² + 100(y-x²)²—notoriously difficult due to its curved valley.

Momentum significantly accelerates convergence in narrow valleys compared to vanilla GD.

For Lipschitz-continuous gradients, convergence requires 0 < α < 2/L.

**Title:** I built a gradient descent visualizer from scratch—here's what I learned about learning rates and momentum

**Body:**

Hey everyone! I created a notebook exploring gradient descent optimization and wanted to share some insights.

**What is Gradient Descent?**

Imagine you're blindfolded on a hilly landscape and need to find the lowest point. Your strategy: feel which way the ground slopes, then take a step downhill. Repeat until you can't go any lower.

That's gradient descent! The gradient ∇f is like feeling the slope—it points uphill, so we go the opposite direction.

**The Update Rule**

x(k+1) = x(k) - α∇f(x(k))

Where α is the "learning rate" (how big a step you take).

**Key Insight: Learning Rate Matters A LOT**

I tested on a simple quadratic f(x,y) = x² + 2y²:

- α = 0.01: Slow but steady, many iterations
- α = 0.1: Nice balance
- α = 0.3: Faster convergence
- α = 0.49: Nearly oscillating

Too big and you overshoot the minimum forever!

**Momentum: The Speed Boost**

Standard GD is slow in narrow valleys (like the Rosenbrock function). Adding momentum helps:

v(k+1) = βv(k) + ∇f(x(k))
x(k+1) = x(k) - αv(k+1)

Think of it like a ball rolling downhill—it accumulates speed and can power through flat regions.

Ever wondered how computers "learn"? Meet gradient descent—the algorithm behind AI, machine learning, and neural networks.

The concept is intuitive: to find the lowest point of a surface, just keep walking downhill. The math looks like this:

x(new) = x(old) - α × (slope at x)

The "learning rate" α controls step size. Too big = overshoot. Too small = takes forever.

I built a visualization showing how different learning rates affect convergence.

Gradient Descent: The Foundation of Modern Machine Learning

I recently completed an implementation of gradient descent optimization algorithms in Python, demonstrating both standard and momentum-based approaches.

Key Technical Highlights:

• Implemented the core update rule: x(k+1) = x(k) - α∇f(x(k))

• Analyzed convergence properties on test functions including the Rosenbrock "banana" function f(x,y) = (1-x)² + 100(y-x²)²

• Demonstrated that momentum-based descent v(k+1) = βv(k) + ∇f(x(k)) significantly accelerates convergence in narrow valleys

• Visualized the critical importance of learning rate selection—too large causes oscillation, while too small results in slow convergence

For convex functions with Lipschitz-continuous gradients (‖∇f(x) - ∇f(y)‖ ≤ L‖x - y‖), theoretical convergence requires 0 < α < 2/L.

Skills demonstrated: NumPy, Matplotlib, optimization theory, algorithm implementation, technical visualization.

How does AI learn? Gradient descent.

Imagine rolling a ball down a hill to find the lowest point. That's the algorithm:

x(new) = x(old) - step × slope

The visualization shows how different step sizes affect the path to the minimum.

Too big? You overshoot.
Too small? Takes forever.
Just right? Smooth convergence.

Adding "momentum" helps the ball power through flat regions—like building up speed going downhill.

This is the foundation of neural networks, deep learning, and modern AI.
