Six degrees of separation explained mathematically! 🌐

Just 1% random rewiring cuts network path length by 60% while keeping 80% clustering.

The secret behind social networks, brains & power grids.

Small world networks: where local clustering meets global shortcuts.

The Watts-Strogatz model shows that rewiring just 1-10% of connections creates networks with both tight local communities AND short paths between any two nodes.

This explains everything from social networks to neural architectures.

Ever heard of "six degrees of separation"? There's beautiful math behind it!

I just simulated the Watts-Strogatz small world model and the results are striking:

→ At just 5% rewiring probability, path length drops to 38% of original
→ But clustering stays at 82%!

This means you can have tight-knit local communities AND short paths to anyone. It's why your friend's friend knows someone across the world.

Real examples: social networks, brain neurons, power grids.

Implemented the Watts-Strogatz small world network model from scratch in Python.

Key metrics computed:
• Clustering coefficient: Cᵢ = 2Eᵢ / (kᵢ(kᵢ-1))
• Average path length: L = (1/N(N-1)) ∑ d(i,j)

Results for N=100, K=6:
• Small world regime: 0.01 < p < 0.1
• At p≈0.05: C(p)/C(0)=0.82, L(p)/L(0)=0.38

The asymmetry exists because path length is global (sensitive to shortcuts) while clustering is local (needs many rewirings to disrupt).

**Title:** I simulated small world networks and finally understand "six degrees of separation" [Python visualization + code]

**Body:**

You've probably heard of "six degrees of separation" - the idea that any two people are connected through about 6 acquaintances. But why 6? Why not 100 in a world of 8 billion people?

The answer lies in **small world networks**, formalized by Watts and Strogatz in 1998.

**ELI5 Version:**

Imagine 100 people standing in a circle, each holding hands with their 3 nearest neighbors on each side. To pass a message across the circle, it takes ~17 hops on average. Now randomly swap just 5% of those hand-holds to connect to random people across the circle.

Result? Average hops drop to ~6, but most people still have tight local friend groups.

**The Math (simplified):**

The model tracks two things:
- **Clustering** (C): How connected are your neighbors to each other? Stays at 82% of original with 5% rewiring
- **Path length** (L): Average hops between any two nodes. Drops to 38% of original with 5% rewiring

This asymmetry is the magic - clustering is local (hard to disrupt), path length is global (sensitive to shortcuts).

**What I learned:**

The visualization really drove home why this matters. Those few random long-distance connections act as "superhighways" that dramatically shrink the network while local structure stays intact. This applies to:
- Social networks (friends of friends)
- Neural networks (local circuits + long axons)
- Power grids (local redundancy + transmission lines)

Why are we all connected by just "six degrees of separation"?

I coded up a simulation of small world networks and the results are fascinating.

Start with a network where everyone knows their neighbors. Add just a few random long-distance connections. Suddenly the average distance between ANY two people drops by 60%, but local friend groups stay intact!

This is the secret behind social networks, brain wiring, and even power grids.

**Understanding Network Effects: A Computational Exploration of Small World Networks**

I recently implemented the Watts-Strogatz small world network model to better understand the mathematical foundations of network effects.

**Key Technical Findings:**

Using Python (NumPy, Matplotlib), I built the model from scratch and computed:
• Clustering coefficient using local triangle counting
• Average path length via BFS traversal

For a network of 100 nodes with degree 6, the "small world" regime emerges at 1-10% rewiring probability, where:
• Clustering retains 80%+ of original value
• Path length drops to <40% of original

**Professional Relevance:**

This framework explains why:
• Viral content spreads faster than expected (short paths)
• Communities remain tight despite global connectivity (high clustering)
• A few key connectors can dramatically change network dynamics

The asymmetry between local clustering (resilient) and global path length (fragile) has direct implications for organizational design, marketing strategy, and infrastructure planning.

Six degrees of separation, visualized ✨

This plot shows the magic of small world networks.

🔵 Blue line: clustering (local connections)
🔴 Red line: path length (global reach)

As we add random shortcuts:
→ Path length PLUMMETS (easy to reach anyone)
→ Clustering STAYS HIGH (tight friend groups)

The green zone? That's the sweet spot where networks are both connected AND clustered.

Your brain, your social network, even power grids - they all live in this zone.
