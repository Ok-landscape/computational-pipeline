Two neural networks walk into a bar. One generates fake data, the other calls it out. Together they learn to create perfect forgeries.

That's a GAN - and we built one from scratch in NumPy.

Implemented a Generative Adversarial Network from scratch using only NumPy.

The minimax game: Generator maps latent z → data x, Discriminator classifies real vs fake.

At equilibrium: D(x) ≈ 0.5 everywhere, meaning G perfectly learned the data distribution.

Built a GAN from scratch in pure NumPy to understand the math!

The core idea: Two networks compete in a minimax game
• Generator: tries to create realistic samples
• Discriminator: tries to spot the fakes

The magic happens when they reach equilibrium - the generator learns to perfectly mimic a bimodal Gaussian mixture.

Key insight: The optimal discriminator outputs D*(x) = p_data(x) / (p_data(x) + p_g(x))

When training succeeds, this approaches 0.5 everywhere!

Implemented GANs from first principles in NumPy.

The minimax objective:
min_G max_D V(D,G) = E[log D(x)] + E[log(1 - D(G(z)))]

Key theoretical results:
• Optimal discriminator: D*(x) = p_data/(p_data + p_g)
• Global optimum: C(G) = -log(4) when p_g = p_data
• Objective reformulates as Jensen-Shannon divergence

The code trains on a bimodal Gaussian - watching the generator learn to split its output across both modes is deeply satisfying.

**Title:** I built a GAN from scratch in NumPy to really understand how they work - here's what I learned

**Body:**

**TL;DR:** Implemented a Generative Adversarial Network using only NumPy (no PyTorch/TensorFlow) to learn a bimodal distribution. The math is beautiful.

**What's a GAN?**

Imagine two neural networks playing a game:
- **Generator (G):** Creates fake data samples from random noise
- **Discriminator (D):** Tries to tell real samples from fake ones

They compete: G tries to fool D, while D tries to catch G. Through this adversarial process, G eventually learns to generate samples indistinguishable from real data.

**The Math (simplified)**

The training objective is a minimax game:

min_G max_D V(D,G) = E[log D(x)] + E[log(1 - D(G(z)))]

Where:
- E[log D(x)] = how well D identifies real samples
- E[log(1 - D(G(z)))] = how well D catches fakes

**Cool Theoretical Results**

1. The optimal discriminator is: D*(x) = p_data(x) / (p_data(x) + p_g(x))

2. When training succeeds perfectly, D outputs 0.5 for everything (can't tell the difference!)

3. The global optimum loss is -log(4) ≈ -1.386

**What I Learned**

- The generator doesn't directly see real data - it only gets gradients through the discriminator
- Mode collapse is real - early training often gets stuck generating samples in just one mode
- The non-saturating loss (-log D(G(z)) instead of log(1-D(G(z)))) provides much better gradients

Ever wonder how AI creates realistic images and data?

I built a Generative Adversarial Network from scratch to find out. It's like a forger vs. detective game:

• The Generator creates fake samples
• The Discriminator tries to catch them
• They get better together until the fakes are perfect

The coolest part? When training succeeds, the discriminator literally can't tell the difference anymore - it outputs 50/50 for everything!

Implemented a Generative Adversarial Network from First Principles

Understanding deep learning architectures requires going beyond API calls. I built a complete GAN implementation in pure NumPy to internalize the mathematical foundations.

**Technical Approach:**
• Implemented forward/backward passes for both generator and discriminator networks
• Used leaky ReLU activations and manual gradient computation
• Trained on a bimodal Gaussian mixture to visualize mode learning

**Key Mathematical Insights:**
• The minimax objective reformulates as Jensen-Shannon divergence minimization
• Optimal discriminator: D*(x) = p_data(x) / (p_data(x) + p_g(x))
• Global optimum achieved when generator distribution matches data distribution

**Results:**
The implementation successfully learned the bimodal target distribution, with the discriminator converging toward D(x) ≈ 0.5 - indicating the generator produces samples indistinguishable from real data.

**Skills Demonstrated:** NumPy, Neural Network Implementation, Backpropagation, Generative Models, Mathematical Analysis

Two networks, one goal: create perfect fakes

This is a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) learning to generate data from scratch.

The red and blue histograms show how the generator's output evolves from random noise to matching the true bimodal distribution.

When training succeeds, even the discriminator can't tell what's real anymore.

Built from scratch in NumPy - no frameworks, just math.
