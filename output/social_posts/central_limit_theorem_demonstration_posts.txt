Why do sample means always look normal? The Central Limit Theorem: as n→∞, X̄ₙ → N(μ, σ²/n) regardless of the original distribution! Tested on Uniform, Exponential & Poisson - all converge beautifully.

The Central Limit Theorem is statistical magic: take ANY distribution with finite variance, compute sample means, and they converge to a normal distribution as n increases.

Demonstrated with 10,000 simulations across 3 distributions. The "rule of 30" holds remarkably well.

Just ran 10,000 simulations demonstrating the Central Limit Theorem and the results are beautiful.

Here's the magic: Take samples from ANY distribution - uniform, exponential, Poisson, whatever. Compute the sample mean. As your sample size increases, those means converge to a normal distribution.

The formula: Zₙ = (X̄ₙ - μ)/(σ/√n) → N(0, 1)

By n=30, you get a solid normal approximation. By n=100, it's nearly perfect. This is why t-tests and confidence intervals work!

Central Limit Theorem demonstration using Python: simulated 10,000 experiments for Uniform(0,1), Exponential(λ=1), and Poisson(λ=3) distributions.

Key findings:
- n=1: Original distribution shape
- n=5: Convergence begins
- n=30: Good normal approximation (KS p-values > 0.05)
- n=100: Excellent fit to N(0,1)

The standardized sample mean (X̄ₙ - μ)/(σ/√n) converges at rate O(1/√n) per Berry-Esseen theorem.

Code uses numpy, scipy, matplotlib. Full analysis with KS tests and kurtosis measures.

**Title:** I simulated the Central Limit Theorem 10,000 times - here's what I learned about why sample means are always normal

**Body:**

Ever wondered why statisticians are obsessed with normal distributions? The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is why - and I built a Python simulation to see it in action.

**The Core Idea (ELI5):**

Imagine you have a bag of weird-shaped dice. Each die has its own strange distribution of outcomes. Now, roll n dice and take the average. Do this thousands of times.

Here's the magic: as n gets larger, those averages will form a bell curve - no matter how weird your original dice were!

**The Math (Unicode, not LaTeX):**

If you have random samples X₁, X₂, ..., Xₙ with mean μ and standard deviation σ, then the standardized sample mean:

Zₙ = (X̄ₙ - μ)/(σ/√n)

converges to a standard normal N(0,1) as n → ∞.

**What I Tested:**

1. **Uniform(0, 1)** - flat distribution
2. **Exponential(λ=1)** - heavily right-skewed
3. **Poisson(λ=3)** - discrete, asymmetric

For each, I generated 10,000 sample means at n = 1, 5, 30, and 100.

**Results:**

- At n=1, you see the original distribution
- At n=5, it's starting to look bell-shaped
- At n=30 (the famous "rule of 30"), you get a solid normal approximation
- At n=100, it's nearly indistinguishable from a perfect normal

I used Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to quantify this - by n=30, p-values were consistently above 0.05, confirming normality.

**Why This Matters:**

This is why t-tests work. This is why confidence intervals are valid. This is why you can make inferences about populations from samples - even when you don't know the underlying distribution!

I just demonstrated one of the most beautiful theorems in mathematics!

The Central Limit Theorem says that if you take enough samples from ANY distribution and compute their average, those averages will form a perfect bell curve.

I tested this with 10,000 simulations using three completely different distributions - uniform, exponential, and Poisson. By the time you're averaging just 30 samples, they all converge to a normal distribution. Mathematical magic!

Demonstrating Statistical Foundations: The Central Limit Theorem in Action

I recently completed a computational demonstration of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) - one of the most fundamental results underpinning modern statistical inference.

The Project:
Simulated 10,000 experiments across three non-normal distributions (Uniform, Exponential, Poisson) to empirically verify that sample means converge to a normal distribution as sample size increases.

Technical Approach:
- Monte Carlo simulation with numpy for efficient array operations
- Kolmogorov-Smirnov testing via scipy.stats for rigorous goodness-of-fit analysis
- Berry-Esseen bound calculations to verify theoretical O(1/√n) convergence rates
- Publication-quality visualizations with matplotlib

Key Findings:
The "rule of 30" holds remarkably well across all tested distributions. At n=30, KS test p-values exceeded 0.05, confirming adequate normal approximation. At n=100, skewness and excess kurtosis approached zero, matching theoretical N(0,1) parameters.

This work reinforces why t-tests, confidence intervals, and many ML algorithms remain valid even without knowing the underlying data distribution.

Skills demonstrated: Statistical modeling, Monte Carlo methods, Python data science stack, scientific visualization

The Central Limit Theorem is pure mathematical beauty

Take ANY random distribution
Sample from it repeatedly
Compute the averages
Watch them form a perfect bell curve

I ran 10,000 simulations to prove it.

Three wildly different distributions:
- Uniform (flat)
- Exponential (skewed)
- Poisson (discrete)

All converged to normal by n=30

This is why statistics works.
This is why we can make predictions.
This is why data science is possible.

The formula: Zₙ = (X̄ₙ - μ)/(σ/√n) → N(0,1)
