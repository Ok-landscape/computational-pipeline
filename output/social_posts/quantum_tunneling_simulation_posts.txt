Simulated quantum tunneling in Python - where particles penetrate barriers they classically can't cross. The transmission coefficient T follows:

T ≈ (16E(V₀-E)/V₀²)·e^(-2κa)

Exponential decay with barrier width explains atomic-scale imaging in scanning tunneling microscopy.

Just built a quantum tunneling simulation and the physics is wild.

Imagine throwing a ball at a wall and sometimes it just... passes through. That's what electrons do at the quantum scale.

Key insight: Double the barrier width → transmission drops by orders of magnitude. This exponential sensitivity is why scanning tunneling microscopes can image individual atoms!

The math: T ≈ e^(-2κa) where κ = √(2m(V₀-E))/ℏ

Code uses NumPy/SciPy to solve the Schrödinger equation. Pretty plots included.

New notebook: Quantum Tunneling Simulation

Implemented the analytical solution for transmission through a rectangular potential barrier. For E < V₀:

T = [1 + V₀²sinh²(κa)/(4E(V₀-E))]⁻¹

Key results for 10 eV barrier:
• 0.1 nm width, 5 eV particle → T ≈ 0.66
• 0.5 nm width, 5 eV particle → T ≈ 2×10⁻⁵

The exponential dependence on barrier width (e^(-2κa)) is crucial for STM operation, tunnel diodes, and understanding alpha decay.

Full code with probability density visualizations available.

**Title:** I built a quantum tunneling simulation in Python - here's what I learned about particles passing through impossible barriers

**Body:**

Ever wonder how particles can pass through barriers they shouldn't have enough energy to cross? I simulated this quantum mechanical phenomenon and wanted to share the key insights.

**What is quantum tunneling?**

In classical physics, if you throw a ball at a wall with insufficient energy to go over it, the ball bounces back. Always. But in quantum mechanics, particles behave as waves, and there's a probability they'll appear on the other side of the barrier.

**The math (simplified):**

The transmission coefficient T tells us the probability of tunneling. For a barrier of height V₀ and width a:

T ≈ e^(-2κa)

where κ = √(2m(V₀-E))/ℏ

This exponential dependence is crucial - double the barrier width and transmission can drop by many orders of magnitude!

**What I learned:**

1. **Exponential sensitivity**: A 0.1 nm barrier gives ~66% transmission for a 5 eV electron through a 10 eV barrier. Increase to 0.5 nm? Transmission drops to 0.002%.

2. **Energy matters**: As particle energy approaches barrier height, tunneling probability increases dramatically.

3. **Real applications**: This explains how scanning tunneling microscopes achieve atomic resolution, how tunnel diodes work, and even nuclear alpha decay.

**The code:**

Used NumPy/SciPy to implement the analytical solution to the time-independent Schrödinger equation. The transfer matrix method calculates wave function coefficients across barrier boundaries.

Did you know particles can pass through walls? Not magic - it's quantum tunneling!

I simulated this phenomenon where electrons penetrate barriers they shouldn't have enough energy to cross. The probability drops exponentially with barrier thickness - which is why your scanning tunneling microscope can image individual atoms.

Double the barrier width → transmission can drop a million-fold!

This same physics enables flash memory in your devices.

Quantum Tunneling: From Theory to Simulation

Just completed a computational physics project simulating quantum tunneling through potential barriers - a fundamental phenomenon underlying modern technology from flash memory to scanning tunneling microscopy.

**Technical Approach:**

Implemented the analytical solution to the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a rectangular barrier using Python (NumPy/SciPy). The transmission coefficient calculation uses:

T = [1 + V₀²sinh²(κa)/(4E(V₀-E))]⁻¹

**Key Findings:**

The exponential dependence T ∝ e^(-2κa) on barrier width explains:
• STM's atomic-scale resolution (sub-nm tip-sample distances)
• Tunnel diode characteristics
• Nuclear decay rates

For a 10 eV barrier: 0.1 nm width yields ~66% transmission at 5 eV, while 0.5 nm drops to ~0.002%.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Quantum mechanics fundamentals
- Scientific computing (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)
- Transfer matrix methods
- Technical visualization

Quantum tunneling visualized

Particles doing the impossible - passing through barriers they don't have enough energy to cross.

The probability? It drops EXPONENTIALLY with barrier width.

Double the thickness → transmission can fall a million times.

This is real physics:
→ How your flash drive stores data
→ How atomic microscopes see atoms
→ Why radioactive decay happens

Swipe to see transmission probability vs energy and barrier width.

The wave function doesn't stop at the barrier - it decays exponentially inside, then continues on the other side.

Quantum mechanics is beautifully strange.
