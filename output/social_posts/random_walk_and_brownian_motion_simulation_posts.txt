Ever wonder how pollen dances in water? It's Brownian motion!

Simulated 500 random walks & proved:
- Mean square displacement grows with time: ⟨r²⟩ ∝ t
- Final positions form a perfect Gaussian

Simulating Brownian Motion from First Principles

Built a random walk simulator in Python to verify Einstein's 1905 diffusion theory.

Key result: Mean square displacement ⟨X²⟩ = t perfectly matches 500 simulated trajectories.

Central Limit Theorem in action: positions converge to Gaussian distribution.

Just simulated Brownian motion - the random jiggling of particles that Einstein explained in 1905!

Started with simple random walks (flip a coin: go left or right) and watched something beautiful emerge:

After 1000 steps across 500 walks, the final positions form a perfect bell curve. That's the Central Limit Theorem doing its thing!

Even cooler: the spread grows as √t, meaning particles diffuse predictably despite moving randomly.

Physics is wild when you can see it in code.

Implemented 1D and 2D random walk simulations to verify Brownian motion theory.

Results from 500 walks × 1000 steps:

1D: MSD = N(Δx)² confirmed
- Final distribution: Gaussian with σ = √N

2D: Continuous angle distribution
- Radial distances follow Rayleigh distribution
- MSD scales linearly: ⟨r²⟩ = t

Einstein's relation D = (Δx)²/(2dΔt) connects microscopic steps to macroscopic diffusion.

NumPy + Matplotlib, full reproducibility with seed=42.

**Title:** I simulated 500 random walks to understand Brownian motion - here's what I learned

**Body:**

Hey everyone! I just finished a project simulating random walks and Brownian motion, and wanted to share some insights that really clicked for me.

**What is a random walk?**

Imagine flipping a coin at every step: heads you go right (+1), tails you go left (-1). After 1000 flips, where do you end up? Intuitively you might think "back near zero" - and on average, you're right! But individuals can wander surprisingly far.

**The key insight: Mean Square Displacement**

While the *average* position is zero, the *average squared distance* grows linearly with time:

⟨X²⟩ = N × (step size)²

This means the typical distance from origin grows as √N. After 1000 steps with step size 1, expect to be about √1000 ≈ 31.6 units away.

**What I simulated:**

- 500 independent 1D random walks, 1000 steps each
- 500 independent 2D walks (random angles 0 to 2π)
- Calculated mean square displacement at every time step

**Mind-blowing results:**

1. The simulated MSD perfectly matches the theoretical prediction ⟨X²⟩ = t
2. Final positions form a near-perfect Gaussian distribution (Central Limit Theorem!)
3. In 2D, radial distances follow a Rayleigh distribution

**Why does this matter?**

This is exactly how Einstein explained Brownian motion in 1905 - the random jiggling of pollen in water that botanist Robert Brown observed in 1827. The diffusion coefficient D = (Δx)²/(2Δt) connects microscopic random steps to macroscopic diffusion we can measure.

**Tech stack:** NumPy for simulation, SciPy for statistics, Matplotlib for visualization. Used vectorized operations so 500 walks × 1000 steps runs almost instantly.

The code is fully reproducible with np.random.seed(42). Happy to share if anyone's interested!

**TL;DR:** Random walks look chaotic but follow beautiful statistical laws. Distance grows as √t, distributions become Gaussian, and this explains everything from diffusion to stock prices.

Ever wonder why smoke spreads out in a room or why tea diffuses in hot water?

I just simulated the physics behind it - Brownian motion!

Even though each particle moves completely randomly, the collective behavior is perfectly predictable. The math shows that how far particles spread grows with the square root of time.

Ran 500 simulations and the results match Einstein's 1905 theory exactly. Sometimes the universe is surprisingly orderly in its randomness!

Exploring Stochastic Processes: Random Walk & Brownian Motion Simulation

I recently completed a computational physics project simulating random walks and Brownian motion, demonstrating the connection between microscopic randomness and macroscopic diffusion.

Key Technical Achievements:

• Implemented vectorized 1D and 2D random walk algorithms using NumPy
• Simulated 500 independent trajectories with 1000 steps each
• Validated theoretical predictions for mean square displacement: ⟨r²⟩ = 2dDt
• Confirmed Central Limit Theorem convergence to Gaussian distribution
• Verified Rayleigh distribution for 2D radial distances

The project reinforces Einstein's 1905 diffusion theory, showing how the diffusion coefficient D = (Δx)²/(2dΔt) bridges molecular-scale movements to observable diffusion phenomena.

Skills Demonstrated:
- Statistical mechanics fundamentals
- Monte Carlo simulation methods
- Scientific visualization with Matplotlib
- Reproducible research practices (seeded RNG, documented methodology)

This type of stochastic modeling has applications across quantitative finance, materials science, drug delivery modeling, and any domain requiring diffusion process analysis.

The beauty of randomness

Each colorful line is a "random walk" - a particle taking random steps left or right.

After 1000 steps, where do they end up?

Individually: unpredictable
Collectively: perfectly predictable

The gray envelope shows ±2√t - where 95% of walks stay bounded. This is Brownian motion, the same physics that explains:

• How smoke spreads
• How molecules diffuse
• Even stock market movements

500 simulations, 1000 steps each.
Pure math, pure beauty.
