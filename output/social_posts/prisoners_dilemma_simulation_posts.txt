Why do rational people fail to cooperate? Simulated 6 game theory strategies in Python - Tit-for-Tat wins by being nice, retaliatory, AND forgiving.

T > R > P > S defines the dilemma.

Explored the Prisoner's Dilemma through Python simulation. Six strategies competed in a round-robin tournament - Tit-for-Tat emerged as a top performer.

The math is elegant: mutual cooperation yields 3× the payoff of mutual defection (R/P = 3).

Ever wonder why people don't cooperate even when it benefits everyone?

I simulated the Prisoner's Dilemma with 6 strategies competing over 200 rounds. The key constraint: T > R > P > S (Temptation > Reward > Punishment > Sucker's payoff).

Tit-for-Tat - just copying your opponent's last move - consistently outperforms "Always Defect."

The lesson? In repeated interactions, being nice but retaliatory beats pure selfishness. Cooperation can evolve!

Implemented a Prisoner's Dilemma tournament in Python with 6 strategies: Always Cooperate, Always Defect, Tit-for-Tat, Random, Grim Trigger, and Pavlov.

Key findings:
- Payoff matrix: (R,R)=3, (P,P)=1, (T,S)=(5,0)
- Ratio of cooperation/defection payoffs → R/P = 3
- Tit-for-Tat succeeds through reciprocity

Nash Equilibrium is (D,D), yet cooperative strategies dominate in iteration.

**Title:** I simulated the Prisoner's Dilemma in Python - here's why Tit-for-Tat wins

**Body:**

**What is the Prisoner's Dilemma?**

ELI5: Imagine you and a friend are caught by police and separated. You can either stay quiet (cooperate) or snitch (defect). If you both stay quiet, you get light sentences. If you both snitch, you both get medium sentences. But if you snitch while your friend stays quiet, you go free and they get the maximum sentence.

The math says you should always defect - but if you play this game repeatedly, something interesting happens.

**What I built:**

A Python simulation with 6 strategies competing in a round-robin tournament:
- Always Cooperate
- Always Defect
- Tit-for-Tat (copy opponent's last move)
- Random
- Grim Trigger (cooperate until betrayed, then always defect)
- Pavlov (win-stay, lose-shift)

**Key findings:**

1. Tit-for-Tat consistently performs well by being "nice" (starts cooperating), "retaliatory" (punishes defection), and "forgiving" (returns to cooperation)

2. The payoff ratio matters: R/P = 3 means mutual cooperation yields 3× the long-term benefit of mutual defection

3. Unconditional strategies fail - "Always Cooperate" gets exploited, "Always Defect" misses out on reciprocity

**The code uses:**
- NumPy for simulation
- matplotlib for visualization
- Object-oriented strategy classes

This models real scenarios like climate agreements, arms races, and business competition.

Why do smart people fail to cooperate even when it hurts everyone?

I explored this with a Python simulation of the famous Prisoner's Dilemma from game theory. Six different strategies competed over thousands of rounds.

The surprising winner? Tit-for-Tat - a simple strategy that just copies what you did last time. It beats "Always Defect" by building reciprocity.

Lesson: In repeated interactions, being nice (but not a pushover) pays off.

**Computational Game Theory: Lessons from the Prisoner's Dilemma**

I recently built a Python simulation to explore one of game theory's most famous problems - the Prisoner's Dilemma. This exercise demonstrates how computational modeling can illuminate strategic decision-making.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Object-oriented design with a Strategy base class
- Six competing algorithms including Tit-for-Tat, Grim Trigger, and Pavlov
- Round-robin tournament with 200 rounds per match, 50 repetitions for statistical robustness
- Visualization using matplotlib (bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps)

**Key Insight:**
While the Nash Equilibrium predicts mutual defection (D,D), cooperative strategies dominate in iterated games. The payoff ratio R/P = 3 shows that mutual cooperation yields 3× the benefit of mutual defection.

**Business Applications:**
This models scenarios where short-term gains conflict with long-term relationships - supplier negotiations, competitive markets, and partnership decisions.

The winning approach? Be cooperative initially, respond proportionally to defection, but remain willing to forgive and rebuild trust.

THE MATH OF COOPERATION

Why do rational people fail to cooperate?

I simulated the Prisoner's Dilemma - 6 strategies competing over 200 rounds each.

The payoff matrix:
Both cooperate → (3, 3)
Both defect → (1, 1)
Mixed → (5, 0) or (0, 5)

Winner: Tit-for-Tat

It just copies your last move. Simple but powerful.

The lesson?

In repeated games, cooperation beats pure selfishness.

Being nice + being retaliatory = success
