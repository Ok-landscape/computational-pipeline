How do you balance risk vs return? Markowitz solved it in 1952:

Minimize: σₚ² = wᵀΣw
Subject to: wᵀμ = target return

Result: The Efficient Frontier - optimal portfolios for every risk level.

Implemented Mean-Variance Optimization in Python today.

Key insight: The Global Minimum Variance portfolio achieves lower volatility than ANY individual asset through diversification.

Portfolio variance: σₚ² = wᵀΣw
Optimal weights: w* = Σ⁻¹(λμ + γ1)

Diversification works.

Just built Harry Markowitz's 1952 breakthrough: Mean-Variance Optimization

The math is elegant:
- Portfolio return: μₚ = wᵀμ (weighted sum of returns)
- Portfolio risk: σₚ² = wᵀΣw (depends on correlations!)

The key finding? When assets aren't perfectly correlated, combining them reduces risk. The "efficient frontier" shows the best possible return for each risk level.

My 5-asset portfolio achieved a Sharpe ratio of 0.53 at the optimal point. Pure math, real results.

Implemented Mean-Variance Optimization from scratch using scipy.optimize

Technical details:
- 5 assets: US Equities, Int'l Equities, Bonds, Real Estate, Commodities
- Covariance matrix: Σ = diag(σ) × ρ × diag(σ)
- Optimization: minimize ½wᵀΣw subject to wᵀμ = target, wᵀ1 = 1
- Analytical verification using closed-form solution

Results:
- GMV portfolio: 5.12% return, 5.41% vol
- Max Sharpe: 8.03% return, 11.45% vol, Sharpe = 0.526

Efficient frontier hyperbola: σ² = (Cμ² - 2Bμ + A)/(AC - B²)

Title: I implemented Markowitz's Mean-Variance Optimization in Python - here's what I learned about diversification

**What is this?**

Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO) is the mathematical foundation of Modern Portfolio Theory. Harry Markowitz won the Nobel Prize for this work. The core idea: you can get better risk-adjusted returns by combining assets intelligently rather than just picking the "best" one.

**The Math (simplified)**

For a portfolio with weights w:
- Expected return: μₚ = sum of (weight × asset return)
- Portfolio variance: σₚ² = wᵀΣw

The key insight is that variance isn't just a weighted average - it depends on how assets move together (covariance). When correlations are low, combining assets reduces total risk.

**What I Built**

I optimized a 5-asset portfolio (US stocks, international stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities) using scipy.optimize. The code finds:

1. **Global Minimum Variance portfolio**: The least risky combination possible
2. **Maximum Sharpe Ratio portfolio**: Best risk-adjusted return
3. **Efficient Frontier**: All optimal portfolios between these two

**Key Results**

- The minimum variance portfolio had only 5.41% volatility - lower than bonds alone (6%)!
- Optimal Sharpe ratio: 0.526 (8% return for 11.4% volatility)
- Bonds get heavy allocation (70%+) in low-risk portfolios

**What I Learned**

1. Diversification genuinely works when correlations are imperfect
2. Input estimates (returns, covariances) matter enormously - garbage in, garbage out
3. The analytical solution matches numerical optimization perfectly

Ever wonder how professional investors decide what to buy?

In 1952, Harry Markowitz figured out the math. His insight: don't just pick the highest-returning asset - combine multiple assets to reduce risk while maintaining returns.

I built his model in Python with 5 asset classes. The result? A portfolio with lower volatility than ANY individual asset, while still earning solid returns.

The efficient frontier shows all optimal combinations. It's beautiful when the math actually works.

Implementing Modern Portfolio Theory: A Technical Deep Dive

I recently built a Mean-Variance Optimization model in Python to explore the mathematical foundations of portfolio construction. This framework, developed by Harry Markowitz in 1952, remains central to quantitative finance.

Technical Implementation:
- Constructed a 5-asset covariance matrix using realistic correlation estimates
- Solved the constrained optimization problem using scipy.optimize with SLSQP method
- Verified numerical results against closed-form analytical solutions
- Generated the efficient frontier showing all Pareto-optimal portfolios

Key Findings:
- Global Minimum Variance portfolio: 5.12% return, 5.41% volatility
- Maximum Sharpe Ratio portfolio: 8.03% return, 11.45% volatility, Sharpe = 0.526
- Diversification benefit clearly demonstrated: optimal portfolios achieve lower volatility than any single asset

The Capital Market Line (CML) visualization shows how combining the tangency portfolio with risk-free lending/borrowing creates all efficient portfolios.

Skills demonstrated: Quantitative finance, constrained optimization, matrix algebra, Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)

The Efficient Frontier

This curve represents every optimal portfolio possible with 5 asset classes.

Each point = a different balance of risk vs return
Red line = best you can do
Below it = wasted potential
Above it = mathematically impossible

The green star? Global minimum variance - lower risk than any single asset.
The gold diamond? Maximum Sharpe ratio - best bang for your buck.

Harry Markowitz won a Nobel Prize for this.
