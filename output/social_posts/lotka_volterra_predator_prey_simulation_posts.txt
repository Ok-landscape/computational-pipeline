Simulated classic predator-prey dynamics using Lotka-Volterra equations:

dx/dt = αx - βxy
dy/dt = δxy - γy

Closed orbits in phase space = sustained population cycles. Conservation law verified numerically.

Explored Lotka-Volterra predator-prey dynamics with Python/SciPy. Key insight: populations oscillate in closed orbits around equilibrium (x*, y*) = (γ/δ, α/β).

The conservation law V(x,y) = δx - γln(x) + βy - αln(y) stays constant, confirming periodic solutions.

Computational Study: Lotka-Volterra Predator-Prey Dynamics

Just completed a numerical investigation of the classic Lotka-Volterra equations, a foundational model in mathematical ecology developed independently by Lotka (1925) and Volterra (1926).

Key Technical Highlights:

• Implemented the coupled ODE system:
  - Prey: dx/dt = αx - βxy
  - Predator: dy/dt = δxy - γy

• Used scipy.integrate.odeint (LSODA algorithm) for numerical integration over 2000 time points

• Verified the conservation law V(x,y) = δx - γln(x) + βy - αln(y) with <0.01% relative variation

• Visualized phase portraits showing closed orbits around the coexistence equilibrium at (γ/δ, α/β)

Scientific Insights:
The model elegantly captures the quarter-period phase lag between prey and predator peaks—prey must increase before predators can respond. The closed orbits confirm this is a conservative system with sustained oscillations.

While simplified (no carrying capacity, linear functional response), this remains essential for understanding more complex ecological models like Rosenzweig-MacArthur.

Tools: Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
