Built 3 digital filters in Python today:
- Butterworth lowpass (fc=30Hz)
- Chebyshev bandpass (40-60Hz)
- FIR highpass (101 taps)

Zero-phase filtering with filtfilt = no phase distortion

Digital filter design fundamentals: Implemented Butterworth, Chebyshev, and FIR filters to extract specific frequency components from a noisy signal.

Key insight: IIR = fewer coefficients but nonlinear phase. FIR = linear phase but more taps.

H(z) = Y(z)/X(z) in action.

Ever wonder how noise-canceling headphones work? It's all about digital filters!

Just built three types in Python:

1. Butterworth lowpass - super smooth response, grabbed just the 10Hz signal
2. Chebyshev bandpass - steeper cutoff, isolated 50Hz perfectly
3. FIR highpass - guaranteed stable, extracted 200Hz component

The math: y[n] = sum of weighted inputs minus weighted past outputs

Used zero-phase filtering (filtfilt) so the signal doesn't get time-shifted. Pretty satisfying to see those frequency peaks disappear after filtering!

Implemented digital filter design from scratch in Python/SciPy:

Transfer function: H(z) = B(z)/A(z) where coefficients determine frequency response

Filters tested:
- 4th-order Butterworth LP (fc=30Hz) - maximally flat, |H(jΩ)|² = 1/(1+(Ω/Ωc)^2N)
- Chebyshev Type I BP (40-60Hz) - equiripple passband, 1dB ripple
- FIR HP (101 taps, Hamming window) - linear phase, always stable

All poles inside unit circle = stable. FIR has poles only at z=0.

Spectral analysis confirmed clean frequency extraction.

**Title:** Implemented Butterworth, Chebyshev, and FIR filters in Python - here's what I learned about digital signal processing

**Body:**

I've been learning digital signal processing and wanted to share a notebook I put together on filter design.

**The Setup:**
Created a test signal with three sine waves (10Hz, 50Hz, 200Hz) plus noise, then designed filters to extract each component separately.

**What are digital filters?**
Think of them as frequency-selective systems. The basic equation is:

y[n] = Σ bₖ·x[n-k] - Σ aₖ·y[n-k]

The b coefficients weight the input, and the a coefficients create feedback. FIR filters have no feedback (all a=0), while IIR filters use feedback to achieve sharper cutoffs with fewer coefficients.

**Three filter types I implemented:**

1. **Butterworth Lowpass (4th order, fc=30Hz)** - "Maximally flat" means no ripples in the passband. It grabbed the 10Hz component cleanly.

2. **Chebyshev Type I Bandpass (40-60Hz)** - Allows some ripple in the passband (I used 1dB) but gives a much steeper roll-off. Perfect for isolating that 50Hz signal.

3. **FIR Highpass (101 taps, Hamming window)** - No feedback = always stable. Used the window method where you truncate the ideal impulse response. Extracted the 200Hz component with excellent stopband rejection.

**Key insight:** Used `scipy.signal.filtfilt` for zero-phase filtering. This applies the filter forward then backward, eliminating phase distortion. Essential for preserving signal timing.

**Stability check:** All IIR poles were inside the unit circle (max magnitude ~0.78), confirming stability. FIR filters have all poles at z=0, so they're always stable.

You can run this notebook yourself and experiment with different cutoff frequencies and filter orders:

Happy to answer questions about filter design!

Just built digital filters in Python and it's fascinating how they work!

Imagine you have an audio signal with multiple tones mixed together. Digital filters let you extract exactly the frequencies you want:
- Lowpass: keeps low notes, removes high
- Bandpass: isolates middle frequencies
- Highpass: keeps only high notes

Used math to design Butterworth (smooth), Chebyshev (sharp), and FIR (stable) filters. All successfully extracted their target frequencies from a noisy signal!

Digital Filter Design: A Practical Implementation in Python

Signal processing remains a fundamental skill in data science, audio engineering, and IoT applications. I recently developed a comprehensive notebook demonstrating three core filter design methodologies:

**Technical Implementation:**
- Butterworth IIR Lowpass (4th order): Maximally flat magnitude response, ideal for applications requiring minimal passband distortion
- Chebyshev Type I Bandpass: Achieved steeper roll-off by allowing controlled passband ripple (1dB specification)
- FIR Highpass (101 taps): Window method design with Hamming window, guaranteeing stability and linear phase response

**Key Engineering Decisions:**
- Applied zero-phase filtering via filtfilt() to eliminate group delay distortion
- Validated stability through pole-zero analysis (all IIR poles at magnitude < 1)
- Performed spectral analysis using FFT to quantify filter performance

**Results:**
Each filter successfully extracted its target frequency component (10Hz, 50Hz, 200Hz) from a composite noisy signal, demonstrating the tradeoffs between computational efficiency and phase linearity.

Digital filters = frequency magic

Built three types in Python to extract specific frequencies from a noisy signal:

Butterworth → smooth response
Chebyshev → sharp cutoffs
FIR → always stable

The plot shows:
- Top: Filter frequency responses
- Middle: Before/after in time domain
- Bottom: Spectral analysis

Each filter grabbed exactly the frequency it was designed for while killing everything else.

The math involves transfer functions H(z) and poles inside the unit circle for stability.

Pretty satisfying when theory matches practice!
