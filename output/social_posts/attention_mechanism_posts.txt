## 1. Twitter/X (280 chars max)

Implemented attention from scratch in NumPy!

Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QKᵀ/√dₖ)V

The scaling factor √dₖ prevents gradient explosion when dimensions grow large.

Multi-head attention lets models focus on multiple patterns at once.

## 2. Bluesky (300 chars max)

Built a complete attention mechanism in pure NumPy.

The scaled dot-product attention formula:
Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QKᵀ/√dₖ)V

Key insight: the √dₖ scaling normalizes variance to ~1, preventing softmax saturation.

Includes multi-head attention and entropy analysis.

## 3. Threads (500 chars max)

Ever wonder how ChatGPT knows what to focus on?

I implemented the attention mechanism from scratch using just NumPy!

The core idea is elegant: compute compatibility scores between queries (Q) and keys (K), normalize with softmax, then weight the values (V).

Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QKᵀ/√dₖ)V

That √dₖ scaling factor? It keeps gradients healthy when dimensions get large.

Multi-head attention takes this further — different heads learn to focus on different patterns. Some catch local context, others grab global dependencies.

## 4. Mastodon (500 chars max)

Implemented scaled dot-product & multi-head attention in NumPy.

Core formula: Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QKᵀ/√dₖ)V

The scaling by √dₖ is crucial — without it, dot products grow with dimension d_k, pushing softmax into saturated regions with vanishing gradients.

Multi-head attention: h parallel attention ops with learned projections W^Q, W^K, W^V, concatenated and projected by W^O.

Includes causal masking for autoregressive models and entropy analysis of attention distributions.

**Title:** Implemented the Attention Mechanism from Scratch in NumPy — Here's What I Learned

**Body:**

I built a complete implementation of the attention mechanism using only NumPy and SciPy, and wanted to share what I learned.

**The Core Idea (ELI5)**

Imagine you're reading a sentence and trying to understand one word. Your brain doesn't treat all other words equally — you pay more "attention" to relevant ones. The attention mechanism does exactly this for neural networks.

**The Math (Simplified)**

The scaled dot-product attention computes:

Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKᵀ / √dₖ) × V

Where:
- Q (queries): "What am I looking for?"
- K (keys): "What do I have?"
- V (values): "What information do I return?"

The softmax creates weights that sum to 1 — like a probability distribution over what to focus on.

**Why the √dₖ Scaling?**

This was my "aha" moment. When dₖ (dimension) is large, dot products grow proportionally. Large values push softmax into regions where gradients vanish. Dividing by √dₖ keeps the variance around 1, maintaining healthy gradients.

**Multi-Head Attention**

Instead of one attention operation, we run h parallel ones with different learned projections. Each head can specialize — some focus locally, others globally. The outputs are concatenated and projected back.

**What I Implemented:**
- Scaled dot-product attention with optional masking
- Multi-head attention class with Xavier-initialized projections
- Causal (autoregressive) masking
- Attention entropy analysis
- Visualization of attention patterns

**Key Takeaways:**
1. The scaling factor isn't arbitrary — it's mathematically motivated
2. Different attention heads learn complementary patterns
3. Entropy measures how "spread out" attention is (low = focused, high = distributed)

## 6. Facebook (500 chars max)

Ever wonder how AI models like ChatGPT decide what to focus on when reading text?

I implemented the "attention mechanism" — the core technology behind modern AI — from scratch!

The idea is beautiful: when processing each word, the model computes how relevant every other word is, then focuses accordingly. Just like how you naturally pay more attention to important words when reading.

The math: Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QKᵀ/√dₖ)V

**Understanding the Attention Mechanism: A From-Scratch Implementation**

I recently completed an implementation of the attention mechanism in NumPy to deepen my understanding of transformer architectures.

**Technical Highlights:**

The scaled dot-product attention computes:
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKᵀ / √dₖ) × V

Key implementation details:
• The √dₖ scaling factor normalizes variance, preventing softmax saturation when dimensions are large
• Multi-head attention runs parallel attention operations with separate learned projections (W^Q, W^K, W^V, W^O)
• Causal masking enables autoregressive generation by preventing attention to future positions

**Analysis Performed:**
• Attention weight visualization across multiple heads
• Entropy analysis of attention distributions (measuring focus vs. spread)
• Comparison of single-head vs. multi-head patterns

**Key Insight:**

Different attention heads naturally specialize — some capture local dependencies while others model global relationships. This diversity is what makes transformers so effective.

This exercise reinforced how mathematical foundations (variance normalization, softmax properties) directly impact model trainability.

The brain of modern AI, visualized 🧠

These heatmaps show "attention patterns" — how an AI model decides what to focus on when processing information.

Each row shows: for this position, how much should I look at each other position?

Brighter = more attention
Multiple heads = multiple ways of looking at the same data

I built this from scratch in Python to understand how ChatGPT and similar models work.

The core formula:
Attention = softmax(QKᵀ/√dₖ) × V

That's it. This simple equation revolutionized AI.
