Built an RNN from scratch! 🧠

The magic: hₜ = tanh(Wₕₕ·hₜ₋₁ + Wₓₕ·xₜ + b)

Hidden states carry memory through time, letting networks learn sequences like sine waves.

Implemented a Recurrent Neural Network from scratch to understand temporal learning.

Key insight: The hidden state update hₜ = tanh(Wₕₕ·hₜ₋₁ + Wₓₕ·xₜ + b) creates memory across time steps.

Trained it to predict sine waves using backpropagation through time (BPTT).

Ever wondered how neural networks handle sequences like text or time series?

RNNs maintain a hidden state that acts as memory, updating at each step:
hₜ = tanh(Wₕₕ·hₜ₋₁ + Wₓₕ·xₜ + b)

I built one from scratch in NumPy to predict sine waves. The network learns to anticipate the next value by encoding temporal patterns in its hidden units.

The catch? Vanilla RNNs suffer from vanishing gradients on long sequences. That's why LSTMs and GRUs exist!

New notebook: RNN implementation from scratch with full BPTT.

The forward pass computes:
• hₜ = tanh(Wₕₕ·hₜ₋₁ + Wₓₕ·xₜ + bₕ)
• yₜ = Wₕᵧ·hₜ + bᵧ

Backprop requires computing ∂L/∂Wₕₕ = ∑ₜ∑ₖ (∂Lₜ/∂hₜ)·∏ⱼ(∂hⱼ/∂hⱼ₋₁)·(∂hₖ/∂Wₕₕ)

The product of Jacobians causes vanishing gradients since |tanh'(x)| ≤ 1.

Implemented gradient clipping to prevent explosion. Xavier initialization for stable training.

**Title:** I built an RNN from scratch in NumPy to understand how neural networks learn sequences

**Body:**

I wanted to really understand how Recurrent Neural Networks work, so I implemented one from scratch without any deep learning frameworks.

**What I learned:**

RNNs process sequences by maintaining a hidden state that updates at each time step:

hₜ = tanh(Wₕₕ·hₜ₋₁ + Wₓₕ·xₜ + b)

This is the key equation! The hidden state hₜ depends on both the current input xₜ AND the previous hidden state hₜ₋₁. That's where the "memory" comes from.

**The implementation includes:**

1. Forward pass through entire sequences
2. Backpropagation through time (BPTT) - computing gradients that flow backward through all time steps
3. Gradient clipping to prevent exploding gradients
4. Xavier initialization for stable training

**Why vanilla RNNs struggle:**

The gradient ∂L/∂Wₕₕ involves products like ∏(∂hⱼ/∂hⱼ₋₁). Since tanh derivatives are ≤1 and we multiply many of them together, gradients vanish exponentially for long sequences. That's why LSTMs add gates to control information flow.

**Results:**

Trained on 500 sine wave sequences (length 25). The network learned to predict the next value with low MSE. Watching the hidden units oscillate in sync with the input signal was really satisfying!

Just finished implementing a Recurrent Neural Network completely from scratch!

RNNs are the foundation of how AI processes sequences - whether that's predicting the next word you'll type, forecasting stock prices, or understanding speech.

The key insight: these networks maintain a "memory" through hidden states that update at each moment in time. I trained mine to predict sine waves and it works beautifully.

Deep Dive: Building a Recurrent Neural Network from First Principles

To strengthen my understanding of sequence modeling, I implemented an RNN entirely from scratch using only NumPy—no PyTorch or TensorFlow.

**Technical Implementation:**

• Forward propagation with hidden state updates: hₜ = tanh(Wₕₕ·hₜ₋₁ + Wₓₕ·xₜ + b)
• Complete Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) for gradient computation
• Gradient clipping to address exploding gradients
• Xavier initialization for training stability

**Key Insights:**

The vanishing gradient problem becomes clear when you implement BPTT manually. The gradient ∂L/∂Wₕₕ requires multiplying Jacobian matrices across all time steps. Since |tanh'(x)| ≤ 1, these products shrink exponentially, explaining why vanilla RNNs struggle with long-term dependencies.

**Results:**

The network successfully learned to predict sine wave sequences, with hidden units developing oscillatory patterns that encode temporal information.

This exercise reinforced why understanding fundamentals matters—frameworks abstract away these details, but knowing them helps debug issues and design better architectures.

Built a neural network that can remember 🧠

Recurrent Neural Networks process sequences by maintaining hidden states that carry information through time.

The update equation:
hₜ = tanh(Wₕₕ·hₜ₋₁ + Wₓₕ·xₜ + b)

Each hidden state depends on ALL previous inputs.

Trained this one to predict sine waves from scratch in NumPy.
