Why do guitars sound the way they do?

I simulated the wave equation: ∂²u/∂t² = c²∂²u/∂x²

Surprising finding: plucking a string at center excites only ODD harmonics (1, 3, 5...). Even harmonics stay silent!

This is Fourier in action.

Built a vibrating string simulator using finite differences.

Key insight from Fourier analysis: a triangular pluck gives coefficients Aₙ = 8h/(nπ)² · sin(nπ/2)

Since sin(nπ/2) = 0 for even n, only odd harmonics ring out!

Energy conserved to <0.01% with Courant number r ≤ 1.

Just built a complete wave equation solver in Python!

The wave equation ∂²u/∂t² = c²∂²u/∂x² describes everything from guitar strings to sound waves.

What I learned:
• Plucking a string at the center excites only ODD harmonics
• The Courant number r = c·Δt/Δx must be ≤ 1 for stability
• Energy stays perfectly conserved in the numerical solution

The math is beautiful - separation of variables gives eigenvalues λₙ = (nπ/L)² with sine wave solutions.

This is Fourier's legacy in action!

Implemented the 1D wave equation for a vibrating string using finite differences.

PDE: ∂²u/∂t² = c²∂²u/∂x²

Key results:
• Triangular pluck → Fourier coefficients Aₙ = 8h/(nπ)² · sin(nπ/2)
• Only odd harmonics excited (even terms vanish)
• CFL stability requires r = c·Δt/Δx ≤ 1
• Energy drift < 0.01% over 2 seconds

The explicit scheme u[j+1,i] = 2u[j,i] - u[j-1,i] + r²(u[j,i+1] - 2u[j,i] + u[j,i-1]) is simple but powerful.

**Title:** I built a wave equation solver in Python - here's what I learned about vibrating strings and Fourier analysis

**Body:**

Hey everyone! I just finished building a numerical solver for the 1D wave equation and wanted to share what I learned.

**The Physics**

When you pluck a guitar string, you're creating a wave that bounces back and forth between the fixed ends. The wave equation describes this:

∂²u/∂t² = c²∂²u/∂x²

where u(x,t) is the string displacement, c is the wave speed (√(T/μ) where T is tension and μ is linear density).

**The Numerical Method**

I used finite differences with the explicit scheme:

u[j+1,i] = 2u[j,i] - u[j-1,i] + r²(u[i+1,j] - 2u[i,j] + u[i-1,j])

The key insight is the CFL stability condition: r = c·Δt/Δx must be ≤ 1 or the simulation explodes!

**The Cool Part - Fourier Analysis**

Here's what surprised me: when you pluck a string with a triangular shape, only the ODD harmonics get excited (1, 3, 5, 7...).

Why? The Fourier coefficients are Aₙ = 8h/(nπ)² · sin(nπ/2)

Since sin(nπ/2) = 0 for even n, those modes don't contribute!

**Results**

• Energy conservation: drift < 0.01% over 2 seconds
• Standing wave patterns emerge beautifully
• Analytical and numerical Fourier coefficients match perfectly

This is why musical instruments have their characteristic timbre - different plucking/striking positions excite different harmonic patterns.

Ever wonder why a guitar sounds different from a piano?

I just simulated how strings vibrate using the wave equation in Python!

The cool discovery: when you pluck a string in the middle, only odd harmonics (1st, 3rd, 5th...) ring out. Even harmonics stay silent!

This is why the same note sounds different on different instruments - it's all about which harmonics get excited.

**Computational Physics: Wave Equation Solver for Vibrating Strings**

I recently completed a numerical simulation project exploring the classical wave equation - a foundational PDE in physics and engineering.

**Technical Implementation:**
• Finite difference method with explicit time-stepping
• CFL stability analysis (Courant number r ≤ 1)
• Fourier mode decomposition and reconstruction
• Energy conservation verification

**Key Findings:**
The triangular pluck initial condition excites only odd harmonics, with Fourier coefficients following Aₙ = 8h/(nπ)² · sin(nπ/2). This mathematical property explains the timbral characteristics of plucked string instruments.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
• Numerical PDE solving
• Stability analysis
• Signal processing (Fourier analysis)
• Scientific visualization (matplotlib, 3D surface plots)
• Python (NumPy, SciPy)

The complete analysis with derivations and code is available here:

The physics of a plucked string 🎸

This simulation shows how a guitar string vibrates over time using the wave equation:

∂²u/∂t² = c²∂²u/∂x²

What makes this special:
→ Only ODD harmonics ring out (1, 3, 5...)
→ Energy stays perfectly conserved
→ Standing waves form between fixed ends

The space-time plot reveals the beautiful interference patterns as waves bounce back and forth.

The math behind music is absolutely stunning.

Built with Python + NumPy + Matplotlib
