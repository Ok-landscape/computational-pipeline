Ever wondered how decision trees actually work under the hood?

I built one from scratch using numpy! The core idea: at each node, find the split that maximizes information gain.

The algorithm uses Gini impurity: G(S) = 1 - Σpₖ²

This measures how "mixed" a set of samples is. Pure nodes (all one class) have G=0.

The result? Interpretable, axis-aligned decision boundaries that separate classes beautifully. No black box here - you can trace exactly why each prediction was made!

New notebook: Decision Tree Classifier from scratch

Implemented using Gini impurity as the splitting criterion:
G(S) = 1 - Σₖpₖ²

Key implementation details:
- Recursive tree growing with depth/sample limits
- Exhaustive threshold search per feature
- O(n·m·log n) training complexity

The model creates interpretable axis-aligned decision boundaries. Each split tests a single feature against a threshold, making the classification logic completely transparent.

Test accuracy achieved on synthetic 3-class data.

**Title:** I built a Decision Tree Classifier from scratch in Python - here's how information theory makes it work

**Body:**

I just finished implementing a decision tree classifier using only numpy, and I wanted to share what I learned about the math behind it.

**The Core Idea (ELI5)**

Imagine you're playing 20 questions to guess an animal. You want each question to eliminate as many possibilities as possible. Decision trees work the same way - at each node, they ask the question that best separates the classes.

**The Math**

The algorithm uses Gini impurity to measure how "mixed" a set of samples is:

G(S) = 1 - Σpₖ²

Where pₖ is the proportion of samples in class k. A pure node (all one class) has G=0, while maximum impurity occurs when classes are equally mixed.

At each split, we find the feature and threshold that maximizes information gain - the reduction in impurity from parent to children.

**What I Learned**

1. Decision boundaries are always axis-aligned (perpendicular to feature axes) because each split tests only one feature
2. Despite simple splits, combining them creates complex non-linear boundaries
3. Controlling max_depth and min_samples_split is crucial to prevent overfitting

The implementation handles multi-class classification and achieves strong accuracy on synthetic clustered data.

Happy to answer questions about the implementation!

Just built a machine learning algorithm from scratch - a Decision Tree Classifier!

The cool part? Unlike "black box" AI models, you can see exactly how it makes decisions. It's like a flowchart that asks yes/no questions about your data until it reaches an answer.

The math is elegant: it finds the questions that best separate different categories using information theory (the same math behind data compression!).

Excited to share my latest project: implementing a Decision Tree Classifier from first principles using Python and NumPy.

**Technical Approach**

The implementation uses Gini impurity as the splitting criterion, recursively partitioning the feature space to maximize information gain at each node. Key components include:

- Exhaustive threshold search across all features
- Configurable stopping criteria (max_depth, min_samples_split)
- Efficient tree traversal for O(log n) predictions

**Key Takeaways**

Decision trees exemplify the trade-off between interpretability and flexibility in ML. While each split is a simple threshold test on one feature, their composition creates complex decision boundaries.

This project reinforced the importance of understanding algorithms at a fundamental level - not just calling library functions, but knowing why they work.

**Skills Demonstrated:** Algorithm implementation, NumPy, Information Theory, Data Visualization, Machine Learning fundamentals

Decision Tree Classifier - built from scratch

The algorithm asks questions about your data,
splitting it until each group is "pure"

How it decides what to ask?
Information theory

Gini impurity measures how mixed a group is:
G = 1 - Σpₖ²

Lower = purer = better

The result?
Clean decision boundaries that separate classes
(swipe to see the visualization)

This is interpretable AI -
you can trace exactly why
each prediction was made

No black boxes here
