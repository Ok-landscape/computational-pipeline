Why do bond prices fall when rates rise? Duration tells you how much!

Modified Duration = Macaulay Duration / (1 + y)

Built a Python tool to visualize this key fixed income concept.

Duration & Convexity: The essential bond risk measures every fixed income analyst needs.

Duration gives the first-order price sensitivity: ΔP/P ≈ -D × Δy

Convexity adds the second-order correction for large yield changes.

Created Python visualizations demonstrating these relationships.

Just built an interactive Python notebook on Duration and Convexity - the fundamental measures for understanding bond price sensitivity to interest rates.

Key insight: Duration alone underestimates price gains when yields fall and overestimates losses when yields rise. That's where convexity comes in - it captures the curvature of the price-yield relationship.

For a 10-year, 6% coupon bond at 5% yield:
• Modified Duration: 7.79
• Convexity: 73.34

Higher convexity = better for investors!

Implemented bond duration and convexity calculations in Python.

Macaulay Duration: D = (1/P) × Σ t × Cₜ/(1+y)ᵗ

Modified Duration: Dₘₒₐ = D/(1+y)

Convexity: C = (1/P) × Σ t(t+1) × Cₜ/(1+y)ᵗ⁺²

Price change approximation:
ΔP/P ≈ -Dₘₒₐ × Δy + ½C × (Δy)²

The notebook includes portfolio duration/convexity calculations and an immunization example. Full Bond class with all methods included.

Title: Built a Python Bond Analytics Tool - Duration, Convexity, and Immunization

Body:

**What I Built**

A comprehensive Jupyter notebook implementing duration and convexity calculations for fixed-income bonds. These are fundamental risk measures that tell you how sensitive a bond's price is to changes in interest rates.

**ELI5: What are Duration and Convexity?**

Imagine you're holding a bond. If interest rates go up, your bond becomes less attractive (why hold a 5% bond when new bonds pay 6%?), so its price drops. But by how much?

- **Duration** answers: "For each 1% increase in yield, my bond price drops by approximately X%"
- **Convexity** refines this: "Actually, the relationship is curved, not linear, so here's a correction factor"

Think of duration as the slope of a curve, and convexity as how much that curve bends.

**Key Formulas (in plain terms)**

- Bond Price = Sum of all discounted cash flows
- Macaulay Duration = Weighted average time to receive cash flows
- Modified Duration = Macaulay Duration / (1 + yield per period)
- Price Change ≈ -Modified Duration × Yield Change + ½ × Convexity × (Yield Change)²

**What the Code Does**

1. `Bond` class with methods for price, yield_to_maturity, duration, and convexity
2. Comparison of duration-only vs duration+convexity approximations
3. Visualization of price-yield curves and approximation errors
4. Portfolio duration/convexity as weighted averages
5. Duration immunization strategy example

**Example Output**

For a $1000 face value, 6% coupon, 10-year bond at 5% yield:
- Price: $1,077.95
- Macaulay Duration: 7.99 years
- Modified Duration: 7.79
- Convexity: 73.34

**Key Takeaway**

Duration alone underestimates gains and overestimates losses. Convexity captures why bonds with higher convexity are more valuable - they gain more when rates fall than they lose when rates rise.

Happy to answer questions about the implementation!

Ever wonder why bond prices move when interest rates change?

I created a Python notebook exploring Duration and Convexity - the key measures that quantify this relationship.

Duration tells you the percentage price change for a 1% yield shift. Convexity adds precision by capturing the curve's bend.

Fun fact: Higher convexity is always good for bondholders - you gain more when rates fall than you lose when they rise!

Sharing a computational finance project: Duration and Convexity Analysis in Python

In fixed income portfolio management, duration and convexity are indispensable risk measures. This notebook implements both from first principles.

Technical Highlights:
• Object-oriented Bond class with full analytics suite
• Numerical validation comparing approximations to actual price changes
• Portfolio-level duration and convexity calculations
• Duration immunization strategy for liability matching

Key Results:
For a 10-year, 6% semi-annual coupon bond at 5% YTM:
- Modified Duration: 7.79
- Convexity: 73.34
- Dollar Duration: $8,402

The analysis demonstrates that duration-only approximations can have significant errors for large yield changes (±200bp), while the duration+convexity approximation reduces errors to near-zero.

Skills demonstrated: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, fixed income analytics, quantitative finance, risk management.

Duration & Convexity
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The essential bond risk measures, visualized.

Duration = how sensitive is the price to yield changes?
Convexity = how curved is that relationship?

Key insight from this analysis:

Higher convexity = better for investors

You gain more when yields fall than you lose when yields rise. That's the power of convexity!

Built in Python with NumPy & Matplotlib
