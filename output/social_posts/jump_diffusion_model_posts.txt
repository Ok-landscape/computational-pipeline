Why do markets crash suddenly? Regular models can't explain it.

Merton's Jump Diffusion adds Poisson jumps to capture sudden price shocks:
dS = μS dt + σS dW + S dJ

Fat tails > normal distribution

The Black-Scholes model assumes smooth price changes—but markets jump.

Merton's 1976 Jump Diffusion Model adds compound Poisson jumps:
S_t = S₀ exp[(μ - σ²/2)t + σW_t] × ∏Yᵢ

Result: fat tails + skewness that match real market data.

Implemented in Python with Monte Carlo simulation.

Ever wonder why your stock portfolio can crash overnight?

Standard models assume prices move smoothly. Reality: they JUMP.

Merton's Jump Diffusion Model (1976) captures this by adding random jumps to geometric Brownian motion:

dS = μS dt + σS dW + S dJ

Where J is a compound Poisson process with intensity λ (jumps per year).

The result? Higher kurtosis (fat tails) and skewness—just like real markets.

Simulated 1000 paths in Python. The difference from basic GBM is striking.

Implemented Merton's Jump Diffusion Model—extending GBM with compound Poisson jumps.

The SDE: dS_t = μS_t dt + σS_t dW_t + S_{t⁻} dJ_t

Where J_t = Σᵢ(Yᵢ - 1), with N_t ~ Poisson(λ)

Key findings from Monte Carlo (1000 paths):
• Higher kurtosis vs GBM → fat tails
• Negative skewness with μⱼ < 0 → downward jump bias
• Better captures tail risk

Jump intensity λ = 0.75/year, log-jump mean μⱼ = -0.05

Code uses numpy/scipy, visualizes terminal distributions.

**Title:** Implementing Merton's Jump Diffusion Model in Python—Why Markets Don't Follow the Normal Distribution

**Body:**

**TL;DR:** Standard stock price models assume smooth, continuous changes. But markets crash suddenly. Merton's Jump Diffusion fixes this by adding random "jumps" to the price process.

---

**The Problem with Black-Scholes**

The classic Black-Scholes model assumes stock prices follow Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM):

dS = μS dt + σS dW

This gives you a log-normal distribution of returns—nice and symmetric with thin tails. But real markets have:
- Fat tails (extreme events happen more often)
- Skewness (crashes are sharper than rallies)
- Sudden discontinuous moves

**Merton's Solution (1976)**

Add a compound Poisson jump process:

dS = μS dt + σS dW + S dJ

Where:
- J_t = Σ(Yᵢ - 1) is the cumulative jump
- N_t ~ Poisson(λ) counts jumps
- Yᵢ are log-normal jump multipliers

**What I Implemented**

Monte Carlo simulation with:
- S₀ = 100 (initial price)
- λ = 0.75 jumps/year
- μⱼ = -0.05 (negative jump bias)
- σⱼ = 0.1 (jump volatility)
- 1000 paths, daily steps for 1 year

**Results**

| Metric | Jump Diffusion | GBM |
|--------|---------------|-----|
| Kurtosis | Higher | ~0 (normal) |
| Skewness | Negative | ~0 |
| Tail risk | Captured | Underestimated |

**Key Takeaway**

If you're doing risk management or option pricing, GBM underestimates tail risk. Jump Diffusion gives you those fat tails that match real market behavior.

Why do stock markets crash so suddenly?

I built a simulation to explore this. The standard model (Black-Scholes) assumes prices move smoothly—but real markets JUMP.

Merton's Jump Diffusion Model adds random shocks to capture sudden crashes and rallies. The math:

dS = μS dt + σS dW + S dJ

Result: "fat tails" that match how real markets behave.

Ran 1000 simulations—the difference from basic models is clear.

**Quantitative Finance: Implementing Merton's Jump Diffusion Model**

The Black-Scholes framework revolutionized option pricing, but its assumption of continuous price movements doesn't capture market reality. In 1976, Robert Merton extended the model with compound Poisson jumps:

dS_t = μS_t dt + σS_t dW_t + S_{t⁻} dJ_t

This addresses a critical limitation: standard geometric Brownian motion underestimates tail risk.

**Implementation Details:**
- Monte Carlo simulation with 1000 paths
- Parameters: λ = 0.75 (jump intensity), μⱼ = -0.05 (log-jump mean)
- Comparison against pure GBM baseline

**Key Findings:**
- Jump Diffusion exhibits higher kurtosis (fat tails)
- Negative skewness captures asymmetric crash risk
- Terminal distributions show meaningful divergence from log-normal

**Applications:**
- Risk management (VaR/CVaR estimation)
- Out-of-the-money option pricing
- Portfolio stress testing

This implementation uses Python (numpy, scipy, matplotlib) with fully documented Monte Carlo code.

Markets don't move smoothly—they JUMP.

This visualization shows the difference between standard price models and Merton's Jump Diffusion.

The blue paths include sudden jumps (Poisson process).
The red paths are smooth continuous movement.

Notice the fat tails in the distribution? That's what real market crashes look like.

Parameters:
• Jump intensity λ = 0.75/year
• Negative jump bias μⱼ = -0.05
• 1000 simulated paths

Built with Python
numpy + scipy + matplotlib
