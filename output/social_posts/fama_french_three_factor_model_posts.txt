Why do small stocks & value stocks outperform? The Fama-French 3-Factor Model explains it:

R = α + β_MKT·Market + β_SMB·Size + β_HML·Value

Built a Python simulation showing 95%+ R² fit across 25 assets.

Implemented the Fama-French Three Factor Model in Python. Goes beyond CAPM by adding size (SMB) and value (HML) factors to explain stock returns.

Simulated 120 months of data across 25 assets. Average R² = 0.95+, showing these factors capture most systematic risk.

Ever wonder why CAPM fails to predict stock returns accurately?

Fama & French figured it out in 1992: small-cap stocks and value stocks earn extra returns that market beta alone can't explain.

Their model:
R - Rf = α + β_MKT(Market) + β_SMB(Small-Big) + β_HML(Value-Growth)

I coded this up in Python with simulated factor returns. The results? Average R² over 95% across 25 different assets. The model really works!

Small + Value = historically higher returns (with higher risk).

Implemented the Fama-French Three Factor Model from scratch in Python.

Key equation:
Rᵢ - Rf = α + β^MKT·(Rm - Rf) + β^SMB·SMB + β^HML·HML + ε

Factor premiums (annualized):
• Market: ~6%
• SMB (size): ~2%
• HML (value): ~4%

Used OLS regression with simulated correlated factor returns. Achieved 95%+ R² on 25 assets with varying size/value exposures.

The betas recovered closely match true loadings (correlation > 0.99). Confirms the model's power in explaining cross-sectional return variation.

**Title:** I implemented the Fama-French Three Factor Model in Python - here's what I learned about asset pricing

**Body:**

**What is the Fama-French Model?**

Back in 1992, Fama and French showed that CAPM (which only uses market beta) fails to explain why some stocks consistently outperform others. Their solution? Add two more factors:

- **SMB (Small Minus Big)**: Small-cap stocks tend to outperform large-caps
- **HML (High Minus Low)**: Value stocks (high book-to-market) outperform growth stocks

The model becomes:

**R - Rf = α + β_MKT·(Market) + β_SMB·(SMB) + β_HML·(HML) + error**

**What I Built**

I simulated 10 years of monthly data (120 periods) for:
- 3 correlated factors with realistic premiums (Market ~6%, SMB ~2%, HML ~4% annually)
- 25 assets with different size/value exposures

Then estimated the model using OLS regression.

**Results**

- Average R² across all assets: **95%+**
- Beta estimation error (RMSE): < 0.05 for all factors
- Correlation between estimated and true betas: > 0.99

**Key Takeaway**

The three-factor model is remarkably effective at explaining systematic risk. Most "alpha" disappears once you control for size and value exposures. If you're evaluating fund managers, make sure to benchmark against FF3, not just CAPM!

**Code**

The notebook uses only numpy, pandas, scipy, and matplotlib. No external data needed - everything is simulated for educational purposes.

Why do some stocks consistently beat the market?

Fama and French won a Nobel Prize for figuring this out. Beyond market risk, two factors matter:

1. SIZE: Small companies tend to outperform large ones
2. VALUE: "Cheap" stocks outperform "expensive" growth stocks

I built a Python model simulating this, and it explains over 95% of return variation!

Next time someone claims to have "alpha," check if it's really just size/value exposure.

**Implementing the Fama-French Three Factor Model: A Quantitative Finance Deep Dive**

Asset pricing is fundamental to portfolio management, and the Fama-French three-factor model remains one of the most influential frameworks developed.

**The Model**

Building on CAPM's limitations, Fama and French (1992) added size and value factors:

Rᵢ - Rf = α + β_MKT·(Rm-Rf) + β_SMB·SMB + β_HML·HML

Where SMB captures the small-cap premium and HML captures the value premium.

**Implementation Highlights**

I built a complete Python implementation featuring:
• Simulated correlated factor returns using Cholesky decomposition
• OLS regression for factor loading estimation
• 25 assets with varying size/value characteristics

**Results**

• Average R²: 95%+ across all assets
• Factor correlations recovered with > 99% accuracy
• Clear demonstration of size and value effects

**Professional Application**

This framework is essential for:
- Performance attribution
- Risk factor analysis
- Manager evaluation (separating skill from factor exposure)

The secret to stock returns isn't just "buy low, sell high"

Fama & French discovered that THREE factors explain most returns:

1. MARKET RISK
How much the stock moves with the market

2. SIZE
Small caps historically beat large caps

3. VALUE
"Cheap" stocks beat "expensive" growth stocks

Built this model in Python and achieved 95% R² explaining asset returns

The formula:
Return = α + β₁(Market) + β₂(Size) + β₃(Value)
