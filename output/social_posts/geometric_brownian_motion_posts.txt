Exploring Geometric Brownian Motion - the stochastic process behind the Black-Scholes model.

Simulated 1000 paths showing how stock prices evolve: dS = μS dt + σS dW

Compared exact analytical solution vs Euler-Maruyama discretization. Both converge beautifully.

Ever wonder how quants model stock prices?

Meet Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) - where the logarithm of price follows a random walk with drift.

The equation: dS = μS dt + σS dW

Key insight: Terminal prices follow a log-normal distribution, which I verified with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (p > 0.05).

Simulated 1000 paths over 252 trading days. The exact method vs Euler-Maruyama both nail the theoretical mean of 105.13.

This is the foundation of options pricing!

Implemented Geometric Brownian Motion simulation in Python with two approaches:

1. Exact: S(t) = S₀ exp[(μ - σ²/2)t + σW(t)]
2. Euler-Maruyama discretization

Results from 1000 Monte Carlo paths:
- Theoretical E[S_T] = 105.13
- Simulated mean matches within <1% error
- K-S test confirms log-normality (p > 0.05)

GBM assumes constant μ and σ - real markets need extensions like Heston (stochastic volatility) or Merton (jump-diffusion).

Title: Simulating Stock Prices with Geometric Brownian Motion in Python - Complete Tutorial

Body:

**What is GBM?**

Geometric Brownian Motion is the mathematical model behind the famous Black-Scholes options pricing formula. It describes how stock prices evolve over time with two components:

- **Drift (μ)**: The expected return rate (like 5% annual growth)
- **Volatility (σ)**: How much prices fluctuate (like 20% annual volatility)

**The Math (simplified)**

The price S at time t follows:

S(t) = S₀ × exp[(μ - σ²/2)t + σW(t)]

Where W(t) is a Wiener process (random walk). The key insight is that log-returns are normally distributed, so prices are log-normally distributed.

**What I Built**

I simulated 1000 price paths over 252 trading days (1 year) using:
1. Exact analytical solution
2. Euler-Maruyama numerical method

**Results**

- Starting price: 100
- Expected final price: 105.13 (from e^(0.05×1))
- Simulated mean: ~105 (both methods)
- Kolmogorov-Smirnov test confirms log-normality

**Key Takeaway**

GBM is elegant but limited - it assumes constant volatility, which real markets violate (see: 2008, 2020). Extensions like stochastic volatility models address this.

How do banks and hedge funds model stock prices?

They use something called Geometric Brownian Motion - a mathematical model where prices drift upward on average but randomly fluctuate around that trend.

I built a Python simulation with 1000 different possible price paths over a year. The cool part? Even though each path is random, their overall distribution perfectly matches the theoretical prediction.

This is the math behind options trading!

Geometric Brownian Motion: The Mathematical Foundation of Quantitative Finance

Just completed a comprehensive Python implementation of GBM - the stochastic differential equation at the heart of the Black-Scholes model.

**Technical Approach:**

Implemented two simulation methods:
- Exact analytical solution using Itô's lemma
- Euler-Maruyama discretization for comparison

**Key Results:**
- 1000 Monte Carlo paths over 252 time steps
- Theoretical vs simulated mean error: <1%
- Statistical validation via Kolmogorov-Smirnov test confirms log-normal distribution

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Stochastic calculus (SDEs, Itô processes)
- Monte Carlo simulation
- Statistical hypothesis testing
- Scientific Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)

**Limitations Addressed:**
GBM assumes constant drift and volatility. Real-world applications require extensions: Heston model for stochastic volatility, Merton model for jump diffusion.

Understanding these foundations is critical for anyone working in risk management, derivatives pricing, or algorithmic trading.

The math behind stock price modeling

This visualization shows 1000 simulated stock price paths using Geometric Brownian Motion.

Each thin line = one possible future
Black line = expected average
Gray band = 95% confidence interval

The equation: dS = μS dt + σS dW

Where μ is drift (growth trend) and σ is volatility (randomness).

This is the foundation of options pricing and risk management in finance.

Built with Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
