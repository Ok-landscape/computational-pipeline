At p ≈ 0.593, something magical happens: random dots suddenly connect across an entire grid.

This is percolation theory - explaining everything from coffee filters to disease spread.

Percolation theory reveals a critical threshold: at p_c ≈ 0.593, isolated clusters suddenly merge into a spanning network.

Explored this phase transition computationally - the math behind coffee brewing, epidemic spread, and network resilience.

Ever wonder why coffee flows through a filter at a certain grind size but not finer?

That's percolation theory! There's a magic number (p_c ≈ 0.593 for 2D grids) where isolated clusters suddenly connect across the whole system.

Below it: nothing spans. Above it: connectivity emerges.

Built a Python simulation showing this phase transition - watching random dots suddenly form a highway across the grid is oddly satisfying.

The same math explains disease spread and internet robustness!

Implemented 2D site percolation with cluster analysis using scipy.ndimage.label()

Key findings:
- Critical threshold p_c ≈ 0.5927 for square lattice
- Order parameter P_∞ shows sharp transition
- Cluster size distribution follows n_s ~ s^(-τ) with τ ≈ 2.055 at criticality
- Finite-size scaling confirms universal behavior

The power-law distribution at p_c indicates scale-free structure - no characteristic cluster size exists.

**Title:** I built a percolation simulation in Python and finally understood phase transitions

**Body:**

**ELI5 version:** Imagine a grid where each square is randomly colored black or white. If enough squares are black (above ~59.3%), you can always find a path of connected black squares from top to bottom. Below that threshold? No path exists. This sudden "now you see it, now you don't" behavior is a phase transition.

**What I learned:**

Percolation theory is a cornerstone of statistical physics with surprisingly broad applications:

- **Coffee filters:** Water percolates through when gaps connect
- **Epidemics:** Diseases spread when enough people are susceptible (herd immunity threshold!)
- **Materials:** Composite conductivity depends on particle connectivity

**The math:**

The order parameter P_∞ (probability of belonging to an infinite cluster) goes from 0 to positive at exactly p_c ≈ 0.5927 for a 2D square lattice.

At criticality, cluster sizes follow a power law: n_s ~ s^(-2.055). This scale-free behavior means you'll find clusters of ALL sizes - from tiny to system-spanning.

**Implementation highlights:**

- Used scipy.ndimage.label() for fast cluster detection
- Ran Monte Carlo sampling across probability values
- Observed finite-size scaling (larger grids = sharper transitions)

The code generates visualizations showing how the largest cluster (in red) suddenly dominates as you cross the threshold.

There's a magic number in nature: 0.593

Fill a grid randomly - if more than 59.3% of squares are filled, you'll ALWAYS find a connected path across. Below that? Never.

This "percolation threshold" explains:
- Why coffee flows through filters
- How diseases reach epidemic levels
- When materials become conductive

Built a Python simulation to visualize this phase transition. Watching isolated clusters suddenly merge into a spanning network is genuinely mesmerizing!

**Computational Physics: Exploring Phase Transitions in Random Networks**

Just completed a numerical study of percolation theory - a fundamental framework in statistical physics with applications across materials science, epidemiology, and network engineering.

**Technical Approach:**
- Implemented site percolation on 2D square lattices
- Used scipy.ndimage for efficient cluster labeling
- Conducted Monte Carlo sampling to measure order parameters
- Performed finite-size scaling analysis across multiple system sizes

**Key Results:**
- Confirmed critical threshold p_c ≈ 0.5927
- Observed power-law cluster distribution at criticality (exponent τ ≈ 2.055)
- Demonstrated universal scaling behavior independent of microscopic details

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Statistical physics simulation
- Monte Carlo methods
- Data visualization with matplotlib
- Scientific Python (NumPy, SciPy)

This type of analysis is directly applicable to understanding network robustness, material properties, and epidemic modeling.

The moment order emerges from chaos

At exactly 59.3% density, random dots suddenly connect across an entire grid.

Below: isolated islands
Above: a spanning highway

This is percolation theory - the same math that explains:
- Coffee brewing
- Epidemic thresholds
- Network resilience

The red cluster? It spans top to bottom.
The phase transition? Sharp as a knife.

Swipe to see how cluster sizes follow a perfect power law at criticality
