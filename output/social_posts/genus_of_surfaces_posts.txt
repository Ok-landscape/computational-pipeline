How many holes does your surface have? The genus (g) tells you!

Sphere: g=0
Torus (donut): g=1
Double torus: g=2

Euler characteristic: χ = 2 - 2g

Explored the genus of surfaces today - the topological invariant that counts "handles" on a surface.

Key insight: The Gauss-Bonnet theorem connects geometry (curvature) to topology (genus):
∫K dA = 4π(1-g)

Sphere → 4π, Torus → 0, Double torus → -4π

Ever wondered how mathematicians classify surfaces?

It all comes down to the GENUS - basically counting "donut holes."

Sphere = 0 holes (g=0)
Torus = 1 hole (g=1)
Double torus = 2 holes (g=2)

The magic formula: χ = 2 - 2g (Euler characteristic)

The Gauss-Bonnet theorem then links this to curvature: ∫K dA = 2πχ

So a sphere has total curvature 4π, but a torus has ZERO total curvature. Wild, right?

Built some Python visualizations to see these surfaces in 3D.

Implemented parametric visualizations of surfaces by genus in Python today.

The Classification Theorem states every compact orientable surface ≅ Σ_g (connected sum of g tori).

Verified Gauss-Bonnet numerically:
- Sphere (g=0): ∫∫K dA ≈ 4π ✓
- Torus (g=1): ∫∫K dA ≈ 0 ✓

The homology perspective: H₁(Σ_g; ℤ) ≅ ℤ^(2g)
First Betti number b₁ = 2g gives the number of independent cycles.

Topology + differential geometry = beautiful unity.

Title: Visualizing Surface Genus with Python - From Spheres to Triple Tori

---

**What is genus?**

In topology, the genus of a surface counts its "handles" or "holes." Think of it like this:
- A sphere has genus 0 (no holes)
- A donut (torus) has genus 1 (one hole)
- A figure-8 pretzel shape has genus 2

**Why does it matter?**

The genus completely classifies orientable surfaces! Every compact, connected, orientable surface is topologically equivalent to a "g-holed torus."

**The cool math:**

The Euler characteristic χ relates to genus by: χ = 2 - 2g

The Gauss-Bonnet theorem then gives us: ∫∫ K dA = 2πχ = 4π(1-g)

This means:
- Sphere: total curvature = 4π
- Torus: total curvature = 0 (positive outside, negative inside, they cancel!)
- Double torus: total curvature = -4π

**The code:**

I implemented parametric equations for spheres, tori, and multi-tori in Python using numpy and matplotlib. For the double torus, I used a figure-8 (lemniscate) path with a tube wrapped around it. The Gaussian curvature is color-mapped onto each surface.

I also numerically verified Gauss-Bonnet by integrating K over the surface - sphere gives ~12.566 (4π), torus gives ~0.

How do mathematicians tell surfaces apart?

By counting holes! It's called the GENUS.

A sphere has 0 holes. A donut has 1. That pretzel-looking thing? 2 or more.

Here's the wild part: There's a theorem (Gauss-Bonnet) that says the total curvature of a surface is completely determined by how many holes it has.

A sphere curves "outward" everywhere (total = 4π). But a donut's outside curves outward while the inside curves inward - they perfectly cancel to 0!

Exploring Topological Invariants: Surface Classification with Python

This week I implemented visualizations of the genus - a fundamental topological invariant that classifies surfaces by their number of "handles."

Key concepts demonstrated:

1. Classification Theorem: Every compact orientable surface is homeomorphic to a g-holed torus (Σ_g)

2. Euler Characteristic: χ = V - E + F = 2 - 2g connects combinatorial topology to the genus

3. Gauss-Bonnet Theorem: ∫∫K dA = 2πχ links differential geometry (curvature) to topology (genus)

Technical implementation:
- Parametric surface equations for sphere, torus, double torus, and triple torus
- Gaussian curvature computation and visualization using matplotlib colormaps
- Numerical verification of Gauss-Bonnet theorem (sphere: 4π, torus: 0)

Skills: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, 3D visualization, differential geometry, algebraic topology

This project demonstrates how computational tools can verify theoretical mathematics and create intuitive visualizations of abstract concepts.

Topology is counting holes.

Sphere → 0 holes
Donut → 1 hole
Pretzel → 2 holes

The genus tells you everything about a surface.

And here's the beautiful part: the total curvature of a surface depends ONLY on its genus.

∫K dA = 4π(1-g)

These visualizations show how curvature varies across each surface (red = positive, blue = negative).

On a torus, the outside curves out (+) and inside curves in (-). They cancel perfectly. Total = 0.

Math is art.
