Just simulated the classic SIR epidemic model! 🦠

With R₀ = 3.0, infections peak at 29% of the population on day 47.

Key insight: epidemics end not from immunity—but susceptible depletion.

Explored the 1927 Kermack-McKendrick SIR model—the foundation of modern epidemiology.

The math is elegant:
dS/dt = -βSI
dI/dt = βSI - γI
dR/dt = γI

With β=0.3, γ=0.1 → R₀=3, we see 94% total infection rate.

Code and visualization included.

Ever wonder how epidemiologists predict disease spread? 🔬

I coded the classic SIR model from 1927—and the results are fascinating.

The population splits into three groups:
• S (Susceptible) → can get sick
• I (Infected) → spreading disease
• R (Recovered) → immune

With a basic reproduction number R₀ = 3 (meaning each person infects 3 others), infections peak at 29% on day 47.

But here's the twist: the epidemic ends because susceptibles run out—not because everyone gets immune. Wild, right?

Implemented the SIR compartmental model in Python using scipy's odeint solver.

System of ODEs:
dS/dt = -βSI
dI/dt = βSI - γI
dR/dt = γI

Parameters: β=0.3/day, γ=0.1/day → R₀=3.0

Results:
• Peak infection: 29.5% at t=47 days
• Final epidemic size: 94.1%
• Herd immunity threshold: 66.7%

The model satisfies conservation: S+I+R=1 with numerical error <10⁻¹⁴.

Simple yet powerful foundation for SEIR and age-structured variants.

**Title:** I built a simulation of the classic SIR epidemic model—here's what I learned about disease spread

**Body:**

I've been learning about computational epidemiology, and I just finished implementing the SIR model that Kermack and McKendrick proposed way back in 1927. It's surprisingly simple but captures the essential dynamics of how diseases spread.

**ELI5 Version:**
Imagine a population split into three buckets: people who can get sick (S), people who are sick (I), and people who recovered (R). The model uses three equations to track how people flow between these buckets over time.

**The Math (in plain terms):**
- Susceptibles decrease when they encounter infected people: dS/dt = -βSI
- Infected people increase from new infections but decrease as they recover: dI/dt = βSI - γI
- Recovered just accumulates from infected people getting better: dR/dt = γI

**What I learned:**

1. **R₀ matters a lot** - With R₀ = 3 (each person infects 3 others on average), 94% of the population eventually gets infected. The herd immunity threshold is 1 - 1/R₀ = 66.7%.

2. **Peak timing is predictable** - Infections peaked at 29.5% of the population on day 47. After that, it's downhill because there aren't enough susceptibles left.

3. **Conservation laws are satisfying** - S + I + R = 1 holds throughout. My numerical error was below 10⁻¹⁴.

The code uses scipy's odeint for solving the differential equations, and matplotlib for visualization. It's a great starter project if you want to get into computational modeling.

Happy to answer questions about the implementation!

Ever wondered how scientists predict the spread of diseases? 🦠

I just built a simulation of the classic SIR epidemic model—and the results are eye-opening!

With realistic parameters, the model shows:
→ Infections peak at 29% of the population
→ 94% eventually get infected
→ The epidemic ends because susceptibles run out

This 1927 model is still the foundation of modern epidemiology. Simple math, powerful insights.

**Computational Epidemiology: Implementing the Classic SIR Model**

I recently completed an implementation of the Kermack-McKendrick SIR epidemic model, demonstrating the intersection of mathematical modeling, numerical methods, and public health insights.

**Technical Approach:**
• Formulated the system of ODEs governing susceptible-infected-recovered dynamics
• Implemented numerical integration using scipy.integrate.odeint with adaptive step-size methods
• Validated conservation laws (numerical error < 10⁻¹⁴)

**Key Results:**
With transmission rate β=0.3/day and recovery rate γ=0.1/day:
• Basic reproduction number R₀ = 3.0
• Peak infection: 29.5% at day 47
• Final epidemic size: 94.1%
• Herd immunity threshold: 66.7%

**Skills Demonstrated:**
→ Differential equations modeling
→ Scientific Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)
→ Data visualization and analysis
→ Technical documentation

This foundational model underpins more sophisticated frameworks (SEIR, age-structured models) used in real-world epidemic forecasting.

The math behind epidemics 📊🦠

This plot shows the classic SIR model in action—tracking how a disease spreads through a population.

🔵 Blue = Susceptible (can get sick)
🔴 Red = Infected (currently sick)
🟢 Green = Recovered (immune)

Key insight: The epidemic peaks at 29% infected on day 47, but eventually 94% of the population gets infected.

Why does it end? Not because everyone's immune—but because susceptibles run out.

Simple equations. Powerful predictions.

β = 0.3, γ = 0.1, R₀ = 3.0
