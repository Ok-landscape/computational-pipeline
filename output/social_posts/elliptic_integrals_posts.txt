Elliptic integrals: special functions that solve problems elementary math cannot - from exact pendulum periods to ellipse arc lengths.

Explored the complete integrals K(k) and E(k), verified Legendre's relation (E(k)K(k') + E(k')K(k) - K(k)K(k') = π/2), and computed ellipse circumferences.

Did you know the period of a pendulum isn't constant?

The familiar T = 2π√(L/g) is only an approximation. The exact formula uses elliptic integrals: T = 4√(L/g) · K(sin(θ₀/2))

At 179° amplitude, the period is ~3.5x longer than the small-angle prediction!

I explored these fascinating special functions with Python - computing complete elliptic integrals, verifying Legendre's identity, and calculating exact ellipse circumferences.

The math is beautiful and the code is clean.

Explored elliptic integrals - the special functions that appear throughout mathematical physics.

Key findings:
• K(k) diverges as k→1; E(k)→1
• Pendulum period at 179° is ~3.5x the small-angle approximation
• Ellipse with b/a=0.1 has circumference ≈0.40·2πa
• Legendre's relation verified to machine precision: E(k)K(k') + E(k')K(k) - K(k)K(k') = π/2

SciPy's special.ellipk() and ellipe() use m=k² convention. Clean implementation in Jupyter.

**Title:** Exploring Elliptic Integrals with Python - From Pendulums to Ellipses

**Body:**

Ever wondered why some integrals can't be solved with elementary functions? Elliptic integrals are a perfect example - they arise naturally but require special treatment.

**What are they?**

The complete elliptic integral of the first kind is:

K(k) = ∫₀^(π/2) dθ/√(1 - k²sin²θ)

This integral cannot be expressed using basic functions like sin, cos, exp, or log. That's what makes it "special."

**Why should you care?**

1. **Pendulum physics**: The exact period of a pendulum is T = 4√(L/g)·K(sin(θ₀/2)). The small-angle approximation T = 2π√(L/g) fails badly at large amplitudes - at 179°, the true period is ~3.5x longer!

2. **Ellipse geometry**: The circumference of an ellipse is C = 4a·E(e), where E is the elliptic integral of the second kind and e is eccentricity.

3. **Legendre's relation**: A beautiful identity connecting K and E: E(k)K(k') + E(k')K(k) - K(k)K(k') = π/2, where k' = √(1-k²)

**Python implementation:**

SciPy makes this easy:
```python
from scipy import special
K = special.ellipk(m)  # Note: uses m = k²
E = special.ellipe(m)
```

The notebook includes visualizations of how these functions behave and numerical verification of the identities.

Here's something cool: you can't calculate the circumference of an ellipse with basic math formulas!

Unlike a circle (C = 2πr), an ellipse requires "elliptic integrals" - special mathematical functions that don't simplify to anything elementary.

The same functions describe pendulum motion. Fun fact: a pendulum swinging at nearly 180° takes 3.5x longer per swing than a small-angle pendulum!

I built a Python notebook exploring these functions with visualizations.

**Computational Exploration: Elliptic Integrals in Mathematical Physics**

Elliptic integrals are a class of special functions that cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. Despite this complexity, they appear throughout physics and engineering - from pendulum dynamics to electromagnetic field calculations.

In this computational notebook, I explored:

• **Complete elliptic integrals K(k) and E(k)** - visualizing their behavior across the modulus range [0, 1]

• **Pendulum period analysis** - demonstrating how the exact solution using elliptic integrals diverges from the small-angle approximation at large amplitudes (up to 3.5x difference at 179°)

• **Legendre's relation verification** - numerically confirming E(k)K(k') + E(k')K(k) - K(k)K(k') = π/2 to machine precision

• **Ellipse circumference calculations** - computing exact values for various eccentricities

Technical stack: Python, NumPy, SciPy (special functions module), Matplotlib

This work demonstrates applied mathematical computing skills and scientific visualization techniques.

The mathematics behind a swinging pendulum is more complex than you'd think.

At small angles, physics class tells us T = 2π√(L/g)

But the exact answer uses elliptic integrals:
T = 4√(L/g) · K(sin(θ₀/2))

At large swings, this makes a HUGE difference - nearly 3.5x at 180°!

These same functions calculate ellipse circumferences (which also can't be done with basic math).
