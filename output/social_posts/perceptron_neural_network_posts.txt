### 1. Twitter/X (280 chars)

Built a Perceptron from scratch in Python!

The OG neural network (1958) learns with one simple rule:
w <- w + n(y - y)x

Achieved 100% accuracy on linearly separable data—but fails on XOR. That's why we need deep learning!

### 2. Bluesky (300 chars)

Implemented the Perceptron algorithm—the foundation of all neural networks.

Key insight: It finds a hyperplane w·x + b = 0 that separates classes.

Guaranteed to converge for linearly separable data, but can't solve XOR. This limitation sparked the deep learning revolution.

### 3. Threads (500 chars)

Just built a Perceptron from scratch and it's fascinating how simple the "original neural network" really is!

The algorithm:
1. Compute z = w·x + b
2. Apply step function: output 1 if z >= 0, else 0
3. Update: w <- w + n(error)x

It achieved 100% accuracy separating two point clusters. But here's the catch—it completely fails on XOR because no single line can separate those points.

This exact limitation is what drove researchers to create multi-layer networks and backpropagation!

### 4. Mastodon (500 chars)

Implemented the Perceptron learning algorithm from 1958—still elegant after all these years.

Mathematical core:
- Net input: z = sum of wi*xi + b
- Output: y = 1 if z >= 0, else 0
- Update rule: wj <- wj + n(y - y)xj

Convergence theorem guarantees it finds a solution for linearly separable data in finite steps.

The XOR problem (not linearly separable) demonstrates its fundamental limitation—no single hyperplane can classify it correctly.

**Title:** I built a Perceptron from scratch—the algorithm that started neural networks (with code walkthrough)

**Body:**

Hey everyone! I just implemented the Perceptron algorithm and wanted to share what I learned.

**What is a Perceptron?**

It's the simplest neural network—just one neuron! Invented by Frank Rosenblatt in 1958, it's a binary classifier that works like this:

1. Take inputs x = (x1, x2, ..., xn)
2. Compute weighted sum: z = w1*x1 + w2*x2 + ... + b
3. Apply step function: output 1 if z >= 0, else 0

**The Learning Rule (ELI5)**

When the perceptron makes a mistake:
- If it predicted 0 but should be 1 -> increase weights
- If it predicted 1 but should be 0 -> decrease weights

Mathematically: w <- w + n*(actual - predicted)*x

**Cool Result**

On linearly separable data (two separate clusters), it converged in just 4 epochs to 100% accuracy!

**The Famous Limitation**

It completely fails on XOR—stuck at 50% accuracy. Why? No single straight line can separate (0,0)/(1,1) from (0,1)/(1,0). This limitation nearly killed neural network research until multi-layer networks and backpropagation came along!

**Interactive Notebook**

You can run the full code and experiment with it here:

Happy to answer any questions about the implementation!

Ever wonder how the first "artificial brain" worked?

In 1958, Frank Rosenblatt created the Perceptron—a single artificial neuron that could learn to classify things!

The idea is simple: draw a line to separate two groups. The perceptron figures out where that line should go through trial and error.

I coded one from scratch and it learned to separate data perfectly! But it fails on some problems (like XOR) because not everything can be divided by a straight line. That's why we needed deep learning!

**Revisiting Fundamentals: Implementing the Perceptron Algorithm**

Understanding modern deep learning requires appreciating its foundations. I recently implemented the Perceptron—the 1958 algorithm that pioneered neural networks.

**Technical Highlights:**

- Architecture: Single-layer binary classifier
- Core equation: y = phi(w·x + b) where phi is the Heaviside step function
- Learning: Gradient-free update rule w <- w + n(y - y)x
- Guarantee: Convergence theorem ensures finite-step solution for linearly separable data

**Key Implementation Details:**

- Used NumPy for vectorized operations
- Achieved 100% training accuracy on separable 2D clusters
- Demonstrated the XOR limitation (50% accuracy) showing why multi-layer architectures became necessary

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- Algorithm implementation from mathematical specifications
- Data visualization with Matplotlib
- Understanding of optimization and convergence properties

The full implementation with visualizations is available for review:

The birth of AI in one equation

w <- w + n*(y - y)*x

This is the Perceptron learning rule from 1958—the ancestor of every neural network today!

How it works:
- Take inputs
- Multiply by weights
- If sum >= 0, output 1
- Otherwise, output 0
- Learn from mistakes

I coded one from scratch and watched it draw a perfect line separating two data clusters

But it can't solve everything—the XOR problem broke it completely

That failure pushed scientists to create deep learning

Sometimes limitations drive the biggest breakthroughs
