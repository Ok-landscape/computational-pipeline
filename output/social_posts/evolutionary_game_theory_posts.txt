Why do hawks and doves coexist? Evolutionary Game Theory reveals stable equilibria emerge from simple payoff rules.

Simulated replicator dynamics: dx/dt = x[f(x) - f̄]

Rock-Paper-Scissors never settles. Cooperation dies in Prisoner's Dilemma.

Evolutionary Game Theory explains how strategies spread through populations based on fitness, not rationality.

Key insight: In Hawk-Dove games, the ESS is x* = V/C, creating stable polymorphism.

Prisoner's Dilemma? Defection always wins - the tragedy of the commons in action.

Ever wonder why cooperation is so hard to maintain?

I simulated three classic games using Evolutionary Game Theory:

• Hawk-Dove: Strategies converge to a stable mix (ESS = V/C)
• Rock-Paper-Scissors: Endless cycling, no winner - biodiversity maintained!
• Prisoner's Dilemma: Cooperation dies every time, regardless of starting point

The replicator equation dx/dt = x[f(x) - f̄] shows strategies with above-average fitness grow.

Nature's math is beautiful and brutal.

Implemented replicator dynamics for Evolutionary Game Theory in Python.

The core equation: dx/dt = x[f(x) - f̄(x)]

where f(x) = Ax is strategy fitness and f̄ is population average.

Results:
• Hawk-Dove → converges to ESS at V/C
• Rock-Paper-Scissors → neutrally stable orbits around (⅓, ⅓, ⅓)
• Prisoner's Dilemma → defection dominates (T > R > P > S guarantees this)

Simplex trajectories visualized. scipy.integrate.odeint handles the heavy lifting.

**Title:** I simulated Evolutionary Game Theory dynamics in Python - here's what Hawk-Dove, Rock-Paper-Scissors, and Prisoner's Dilemma teach us about cooperation

**Body:**

I built a Python simulation exploring how strategies evolve in populations using the replicator equation from Evolutionary Game Theory.

**ELI5 Version:**

Imagine a population where everyone plays a game. Instead of assuming people are "rational," EGT asks: which strategies survive and spread based on how well they do against others?

**The Core Math:**

The replicator equation is: dx/dt = x × [f(x) - f̄]

Translation: Strategies doing better than average grow. Those doing worse shrink.

**Three Classic Games:**

1. **Hawk-Dove:** Hawks fight for resources (risky but high reward), Doves back off (safe but low reward). Result: They coexist! The population stabilizes at x* = V/C (resource value / fighting cost). This is called an Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS).

2. **Rock-Paper-Scissors:** No strategy dominates. The population cycles forever around the center point (⅓, ⅓, ⅓). This is why cyclical ecosystems maintain biodiversity.

3. **Prisoner's Dilemma:** Cooperators always lose to defectors, even when starting at 90% cooperation. This is the "tragedy of the commons" - individual rationality leads to collective disaster.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Frequency-dependent selection means your strategy's success depends on what everyone else is doing
- Some games have stable equilibria (Hawk-Dove), some cycle forever (RPS), some converge to bad outcomes (PD)
- Small payoff differences can completely change long-term dynamics

Built with NumPy, SciPy (odeint), and Matplotlib.

Why does cooperation fail even when it benefits everyone?

I explored this using Evolutionary Game Theory - a way to model how strategies spread through populations.

Key finding: In the Prisoner's Dilemma, defection ALWAYS wins, even when most start cooperating. It's the math behind the "tragedy of the commons."

But there's hope! In Hawk-Dove games, aggressive and peaceful strategies can coexist at a stable ratio.

**Modeling Strategic Evolution: A Python Implementation of Evolutionary Game Theory**

I recently completed a computational exploration of Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT), implementing replicator dynamics to analyze three foundational games.

**Technical Approach:**

- Implemented the replicator equation: dx/dt = x[f(x) - f̄(x)]
- Used scipy.integrate.odeint for numerical integration
- Visualized trajectories on the probability simplex for 3-strategy games

**Key Findings:**

1. **Hawk-Dove Game:** Demonstrates convergence to a mixed Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS = V/C), showing how aggressive and peaceful behaviors can coexist in equilibrium.

2. **Rock-Paper-Scissors:** Exhibits neutrally stable periodic orbits - a mathematical explanation for biodiversity maintenance in cyclical competitive systems.

3. **Prisoner's Dilemma:** Confirms that defection dominates regardless of initial cooperation levels, quantifying the "tragedy of the commons."

**Skills Demonstrated:** Scientific computing, differential equations, game theory, data visualization, mathematical modeling.

These models have applications in ecology, economics, and social behavior analysis.

Game theory meets evolution.

I simulated how strategies spread through populations - not by rational choice, but by survival of the fittest.

What I learned:

→ Hawks and Doves reach equilibrium
→ Rock-Paper-Scissors cycles forever
→ Cooperation dies in the Prisoner's Dilemma

The replicator equation:
dx/dt = x × [fitness - average]

Strategies above average grow.
Below average? They disappear.

Nature's algorithm is elegant and unforgiving.

Swipe to see the dynamics unfold.
