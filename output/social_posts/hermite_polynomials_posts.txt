Hermite polynomials: the math behind quantum harmonic oscillators!

H₀(x) = 1
H₁(x) = 2x
H₂(x) = 4x² - 2

These elegant polynomials describe electron wave functions and Gaussian probability distributions.

Exploring Hermite polynomials—classical orthogonal polynomials that appear everywhere from quantum mechanics to probability theory.

Key property: Hₙ(x) has exactly n real zeros, and they satisfy a beautiful recurrence relation:

Hₙ₊₁(x) = 2xHₙ(x) - 2nHₙ₋₁(x)

Just built a visualization of Hermite polynomials and I'm fascinated by their elegance!

These polynomials are the eigenfunctions of the quantum harmonic oscillator—they literally describe how electrons behave in atoms.

Cool facts:
• Hₙ(x) has exactly n zeros
• Even-indexed ones are symmetric, odd-indexed are antisymmetric
• When multiplied by e^(-x²/2), they become square-integrable wave functions

The orthogonality matrix came out perfectly diagonal—math is beautiful when it works!

Implemented Hermite polynomials in Python using scipy.special!

Physicist's Hermite polynomials Hₙ(x) satisfy:
Hₙ''(x) - 2xHₙ'(x) + 2nHₙ(x) = 0

They're orthogonal under the weight function w(x) = e^(-x²):

∫₋∞^∞ Hₘ(x)Hₙ(x)e^(-x²)dx = √π · 2ⁿ · n! · δₘₙ

Verified numerically—the off-diagonal elements of the inner product matrix are all ~0!

Recurrence: Hₙ₊₁(x) = 2xHₙ(x) - 2nHₙ₋₁(x)

Code uses scipy.special.hermite and numpy.trapz for integration.

**Title:** I built a visualization of Hermite polynomials and quantum harmonic oscillator wave functions in Python

**Body:**

Hey everyone! I just finished building an interactive notebook exploring Hermite polynomials—one of the most important polynomial families in physics and mathematics.

**What are Hermite polynomials?**

ELI5: Imagine you're trying to describe how a quantum particle (like an electron) bounces back and forth in a potential well. Hermite polynomials are the mathematical "shapes" that describe these bouncing patterns. The more energy the particle has, the more complex the shape.

**The first few polynomials:**
- H₀(x) = 1
- H₁(x) = 2x
- H₂(x) = 4x² - 2
- H₃(x) = 8x³ - 12x
- H₄(x) = 16x⁴ - 48x² + 12
- H₅(x) = 32x⁵ - 160x³ + 120x

**Key properties I explored:**

1. **Zeros:** Hₙ(x) has exactly n real zeros—this corresponds to the n nodes in the quantum wave function

2. **Orthogonality:** Different Hermite polynomials are "perpendicular" to each other when integrated with the Gaussian weight e^(-x²). I verified this numerically and got a beautiful diagonal matrix!

3. **Recurrence relation:** Hₙ₊₁(x) = 2xHₙ(x) - 2nHₙ₋₁(x). This makes computing higher-order polynomials efficient.

4. **Quantum wave functions:** When you multiply Hₙ(x) by e^(-x²/2) and normalize, you get the wave function ψₙ(x) for the quantum harmonic oscillator.

**What I learned:**

- How to use scipy.special.hermite() for polynomial evaluation
- Numerical integration with np.trapz to verify orthogonality
- The connection between classical polynomials and quantum mechanics

The visualizations include the raw polynomials, normalized wave functions, probability densities, and an orthogonality verification matrix.

Happy to answer any questions about the implementation!

Just explored one of math's most elegant structures: Hermite polynomials!

These polynomials are the hidden math behind quantum mechanics. When physicists describe how electrons behave in atoms, they use these exact formulas.

The coolest part? Each polynomial Hₙ(x) has exactly n zeros, and they're all perfectly "orthogonal" to each other—like perpendicular vectors in higher dimensions.

**Computational Mathematics: Visualizing Hermite Polynomials and Quantum Harmonic Oscillators**

I recently completed an exploratory notebook examining Hermite polynomials—a fundamental mathematical structure with applications spanning quantum mechanics, probability theory, and signal processing.

**Technical Implementation:**

• Used scipy.special.hermite() for polynomial generation
• Implemented numerical integration via numpy.trapz to verify orthogonality relations
• Created four-panel visualization: raw polynomials, normalized wave functions, probability densities, and orthogonality matrix

**Key Mathematical Insights:**

The physicist's Hermite polynomials satisfy the recurrence relation Hₙ₊₁(x) = 2xHₙ(x) - 2nHₙ₋₁(x), enabling efficient computation. Their orthogonality under the Gaussian weight function makes them ideal basis functions for expanding functions of Gaussian random variables.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

Scientific Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib), numerical integration methods, mathematical visualization, and translating theoretical physics into computational experiments.

The quantum world in one plot.

These curves are Hermite polynomials—the mathematical functions that describe how electrons "wave" inside atoms.

H₀(x) = 1
H₁(x) = 2x
H₂(x) = 4x² - 2
H₃(x) = 8x³ - 12x

Each one has exactly n zeros, matching the number of "nodes" in a quantum wave function.

The bottom-right panel shows they're all perfectly orthogonal—different energy states never mix.

Pure mathematical elegance.
