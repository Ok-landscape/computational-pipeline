Where is an electron in a hydrogen atom? Quantum mechanics says: everywhere with probability!

Built Python simulations to visualize orbitals from 1s to 3d using Laguerre polynomials.

E_n = -13.6 eV/n²

Visualizing hydrogen atom wavefunctions with Python.

The electron probability density ψ²(r,θ,φ) shows where electrons are likely found. Key insight: the 1s orbital peaks at r = a₀ (Bohr radius ≈ 0.529 Å).

Energy levels: E_n = -13.6 eV/n²

Computed using SciPy's Laguerre polynomials.

Ever wonder why we draw electron clouds the way we do?

I coded up the exact quantum mechanical wavefunctions for hydrogen atoms in Python. The math is beautiful: ψ = R(r) × Y(θ,φ)

Key findings:
• 1s electrons most likely at r = a₀ (Bohr radius)
• Higher orbitals have nodes where probability = 0
• 2s has 1 node, 3s has 2 nodes

The code uses associated Laguerre polynomials and spherical harmonics from SciPy.

It's wild that we can exactly solve this quantum system!

Implemented hydrogen atom radial wavefunctions R_nl(r) in Python using scipy.special.genlaguerre.

The wavefunction separates: ψ_nlm(r,θ,φ) = R_nl(r) × Y_l^m(θ,φ)

Key results:
• Radial nodes = n - l - 1
• Most probable radius for 1s: r_max = a₀
• Energy eigenvalues: E_n = -13.6 eV/n²

Expectation value: ⟨r⟩ = (a₀/2)[3n² - l(l+1)]

Visualized probability densities r²|R_nl|² for s, p, d orbitals up to n=3.

**Title:** I built a Python simulation of hydrogen atom wavefunctions - visualizing where electrons actually are

**Body:**

I've always found quantum mechanics fascinating but abstract. So I decided to actually compute and visualize the hydrogen atom wavefunctions in Python.

**ELI5 version:** In quantum mechanics, we can't say exactly where an electron is. Instead, we have a wavefunction ψ that tells us the probability of finding it somewhere. For hydrogen, |ψ|² gives the probability density.

**What I built:**

The wavefunction separates into radial and angular parts:

ψ(r,θ,φ) = R(r) × Y(θ,φ)

I implemented the radial part R_nl(r) using:
- Associated Laguerre polynomials (via scipy.special.genlaguerre)
- Proper normalization factors
- Calculated probability densities r²|R|²

**Key insights from the visualization:**

1. **Nodes matter**: The 1s orbital has no radial nodes, 2s has 1, 3s has 2. These are places where the probability of finding the electron is exactly zero.

2. **Most probable radius**: For 1s, the electron is most likely at r = a₀ (Bohr radius ≈ 0.529 Å). This matches the old Bohr model prediction!

3. **Higher orbitals spread out**: 3s electrons can be found much further from the nucleus than 1s electrons.

4. **Energy levels**: E_n = -13.6 eV/n² - only depends on n, not l or m (this degeneracy is special to hydrogen).

**Code highlights:**
- Used numpy for numerical computation
- scipy.special for Laguerre polynomials and spherical harmonics
- matplotlib for visualization

This is one of the few quantum systems we can solve exactly, which makes it perfect for learning.

Just finished a fun physics coding project - visualizing where electrons actually live in hydrogen atoms!

In quantum mechanics, electrons don't orbit like planets. Instead, they exist in probability clouds described by wavefunctions.

I computed these wavefunctions in Python and plotted where electrons are most likely to be found. The math involves Laguerre polynomials (fancy!) but the results are intuitive.

**Computational Quantum Mechanics: Hydrogen Atom Wavefunctions**

I recently completed a computational physics project implementing exact solutions for hydrogen atom wavefunctions using Python's scientific computing stack.

**Technical Implementation:**
• Radial wavefunctions R_nl(r) computed using associated Laguerre polynomials via scipy.special.genlaguerre
• Angular components via spherical harmonics Y_l^m(θ,φ)
• Visualization of probability densities for orbitals from 1s through 3d

**Key Results:**
• Demonstrated the node structure: n-l-1 radial nodes for each orbital
• Computed most probable radii and expectation values
• Verified energy eigenvalues E_n = -13.6 eV/n²

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Scientific Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)
- Quantum mechanical theory implementation
- Mathematical physics (special functions, PDEs)
- Data visualization and scientific communication

The hydrogen atom is foundational to quantum chemistry and atomic physics. This exact solution serves as a benchmark for approximate methods used in more complex systems.

Quantum electron clouds

This is what hydrogen atom orbitals actually look like when you solve the Schrodinger equation and plot the probability densities.

The brighter regions = higher probability of finding the electron

From top to bottom:
• 1s, 2s, 2p orbitals
• 3s, 3p, 3d orbitals

Each orbital has its own unique shape determined by quantum numbers (n, l, m).

Built this visualization in Python using SciPy's special functions for the underlying math.

The math is exact - hydrogen is one of the few quantum systems we can solve analytically!
