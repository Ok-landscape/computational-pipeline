At 80% light speed, 1 year on a spacecraft = 1.67 years on Earth.

The Lorentz factor γ = 1/√(1-v²/c²) is why time dilates and lengths contract.

Exploring the Lorentz transformation - the mathematical foundation of Einstein's special relativity.

When objects approach light speed:
• Time dilates: Δt = γΔτ
• Length contracts: L = L₀/γ

At v = 0.8c, the Lorentz factor γ ≈ 1.67. Visualized with Python and matplotlib.

Ever wondered why time slows down as you approach the speed of light?

It's all in the Lorentz transformation equations!

The key is the Lorentz factor: γ = 1/√(1-v²/c²)

At 80% light speed (v = 0.8c), γ ≈ 1.67
At 90% light speed (v = 0.9c), γ ≈ 2.29

This means if you travel for 1 year at 0.8c, 1.67 years pass on Earth. Moving clocks run slower!

I built a Python notebook showing time dilation, length contraction, and spacetime diagrams. Pretty wild stuff.

New computational notebook: Lorentz Transformation

Implemented the core equations of special relativity:
• t' = γ(t - vx/c²)
• x' = γ(x - vt)
• γ = 1/√(1 - v²/c²)

Key results visualized:
1. Lorentz factor diverges as v → c
2. Time dilation: Δt = γΔτ
3. Length contraction: L = L₀/γ
4. Spacetime interval invariance: Δs² = c²Δt² - Δx²

Numerical examples show a 100m rod at 0.9c contracts to ~43.6m.

**Title:** I built a Python notebook visualizing the Lorentz transformation and relativistic effects

**Body:**

Hey everyone! I created an interactive Jupyter notebook exploring the Lorentz transformation - the mathematical heart of Einstein's special relativity.

**What I learned:**

The Lorentz transformation relates space and time measurements between two observers moving relative to each other. The key quantity is the Lorentz factor:

γ = 1/√(1 - v²/c²)

This simple formula explains some mind-bending physics:

**Time Dilation:** Moving clocks run slower. If a spacecraft travels at 0.8c, for every year onboard, 1.67 years pass on Earth. The formula is Δt = γΔτ.

**Length Contraction:** Moving objects appear shorter. A 100-meter rod moving at 0.9c appears only 43.6 meters long. The formula is L = L₀/γ.

**Simultaneity is Relative:** Two events simultaneous in one reference frame are NOT simultaneous in another. This was the most counterintuitive result for me.

**The Code:**

Used numpy and matplotlib to:
- Plot the Lorentz factor vs velocity (it diverges as v approaches c)
- Visualize time dilation and length contraction curves
- Create Minkowski spacetime diagrams
- Transform events between reference frames

The spacetime interval Δs² = c²Δt² - Δx² is invariant - confirmed numerically to machine precision.

Would love feedback on the visualizations or suggestions for extending this to 4-momentum and relativistic dynamics!

Did you know that if you could travel at 80% the speed of light, time would literally slow down for you?

For every year you experience, 1.67 years would pass on Earth!

This is called time dilation, and it comes from the Lorentz transformation - the math behind Einstein's special relativity.

I created a Python notebook exploring these mind-bending effects with interactive visualizations.

Exploring the Mathematical Foundations of Special Relativity

I recently developed a computational notebook implementing the Lorentz transformation - the cornerstone equations that describe how space and time measurements differ between observers in relative motion.

Key Technical Achievements:

• Implemented forward and inverse Lorentz transformations in Python
• Visualized the Lorentz factor γ = 1/√(1-v²/c²) across velocity ranges
• Created Minkowski spacetime diagrams showing coordinate system transformations
• Demonstrated spacetime interval invariance numerically

Practical Insights:

The notebook includes worked examples showing time dilation (a spacecraft at 0.8c experiences time 1.67× slower than Earth) and length contraction (a 100m object at 0.9c contracts to 43.6m).

Skills Demonstrated: NumPy, Matplotlib, scientific visualization, physics simulation, technical documentation.

This project reinforces the importance of combining mathematical rigor with clear visualization when communicating complex scientific concepts.

Time dilation is real.

At 80% light speed:
1 year for you = 1.67 years on Earth

At 90% light speed:
1 year for you = 2.29 years on Earth

This is the Lorentz transformation in action - the math that makes GPS satellites work and explains why muons from cosmic rays reach Earth's surface.

The equation behind it all:
γ = 1/√(1 - v²/c²)

Swipe to see the spacetime diagrams and visualization code.

Built with Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
