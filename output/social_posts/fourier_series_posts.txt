Explored Fourier series computationally: decomposing periodic functions into sinusoidal components. Key insight: discontinuous functions (square waves) have O(1/n) coefficient decay, while continuous functions (triangle waves) decay as O(1/n²). Parseval's theorem verified energy conservation.

Just built a Fourier series notebook from scratch!

The core idea: ANY periodic function f(x) can be written as:
f(x) = a₀/2 + ∑[aₙcos(nπx/L) + bₙsin(nπx/L)]

Coolest discovery: the Gibbs phenomenon. Near discontinuities, Fourier sums always overshoot by ~8.95%, no matter how many terms you add. It's a fundamental limit of approximating sharp jumps with smooth waves.

Verified Parseval's theorem too - energy in time domain = energy in frequency domain.

New computational notebook: Fourier series analysis

Implemented coefficient calculation via numerical integration and analyzed three waveforms:
- Square wave: bₙ = 4/(πn) for odd n
- Sawtooth: bₙ = 2(-1)ⁿ⁺¹/n
- Triangle: aₙ = -4/(πn²) for odd n

Key observations:
1. Discontinuities → O(1/n) decay
2. Continuous functions → O(1/n²) decay
3. Gibbs overshoot ≈ 8.95% persists at all N

Parseval's theorem verified: ∫|f(x)|²dx = |a₀|²/4 + ½∑(|aₙ|² + |bₙ|²)

**Title:** Built a Fourier Series notebook from scratch - here's what I learned about decomposing periodic functions

**Body:**

I created a Python notebook exploring Fourier series, one of the most powerful tools in mathematical analysis. Here's the breakdown:

**The Core Concept**

Any periodic function with period 2L can be written as an infinite sum of sines and cosines:

f(x) = a₀/2 + ∑[aₙcos(nπx/L) + bₙsin(nπx/L)]

The coefficients aₙ and bₙ are computed using integrals that exploit the orthogonality of trig functions.

**What I Implemented**

- General Fourier coefficient calculator using scipy.integrate
- Analyzed three classic waveforms: square, sawtooth, and triangle
- Visualized convergence behavior with different numbers of terms
- Coefficient decay analysis (log-scale plots)
- Parseval's theorem verification

**Key Insights**

1. **Convergence speed depends on smoothness**: Discontinuous functions (square, sawtooth) have coefficients that decay as O(1/n). Continuous functions (triangle) decay as O(1/n²), converging much faster.

2. **The Gibbs phenomenon is unavoidable**: Near discontinuities, Fourier partial sums overshoot by ~8.95% regardless of how many terms you include. This is a fundamental property of approximating sharp jumps with smooth sinusoids.

3. **Energy conservation**: Parseval's theorem states that energy in the time domain equals energy in the frequency domain. My numerical verification showed less than 0.01% error with 100 terms.

**Code Highlights**

Used numpy for arrays, scipy.integrate.quad for numerical integration, and matplotlib for visualization. The coefficient calculator is general-purpose - just pass in any periodic function.

Ever wonder how music apps visualize sound frequencies? It's all thanks to Fourier series!

Joseph Fourier discovered that ANY repeating wave can be broken down into simple sine and cosine waves. I built a Python notebook exploring this with square, sawtooth, and triangle waves.

The coolest part: there's a phenomenon where the approximation always overshoots by exactly 8.95% at sharp corners - and you can't fix it no matter how many terms you add!

Fourier Series: From 18th Century Mathematics to Modern Signal Processing

I recently completed a computational notebook implementing Fourier series analysis from first principles. This 200-year-old technique remains fundamental to signal processing, audio engineering, and scientific computing.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Built a general-purpose Fourier coefficient calculator using numerical integration (scipy)
- Analyzed convergence properties across three canonical waveforms
- Verified Parseval's theorem demonstrating energy conservation between time and frequency domains

**Key Findings:**

The rate of coefficient decay directly correlates with function smoothness:
- Discontinuous signals: O(1/n) decay
- Continuous signals: O(1/n²) decay

This has practical implications for compression and filtering - smoother signals require fewer coefficients for accurate reconstruction.

I also demonstrated the Gibbs phenomenon, where partial sums exhibit ~9% overshoot near discontinuities - a fundamental limit that affects everything from image compression artifacts to audio synthesis.

**Skills Applied:** Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, numerical methods, mathematical analysis

Breaking down waves into their building blocks

Fourier series lets us decompose ANY periodic wave into simple sine and cosine components.

What you're seeing:
- 3 waveforms (square, sawtooth, triangle)
- Their frequency spectra
- Approximation errors

Fun fact: That overshoot near sharp corners? It's called the Gibbs phenomenon and it's ALWAYS ~9%, no matter how many terms you use.

This is the math behind audio equalizers, image compression, and signal analysis.
