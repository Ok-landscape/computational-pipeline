Just built a Cholesky decomposition from scratch in Python!

What is it? A way to factor symmetric positive-definite matrices as A = LLᵀ

Why care?
- 2× faster than LU decomposition (n³/3 vs 2n³/3 operations)
- Numerically stable
- Memory efficient - only store the lower triangle

Cool application: generating correlated random samples for Monte Carlo simulations. Transform uncorrelated noise z into correlated samples with x = μ + Lz

The math is beautiful and the code runs fast!

Implemented Cholesky decomposition from scratch and benchmarked against SciPy.

For a symmetric positive-definite matrix A, we compute L such that A = LLᵀ

Algorithm complexity: O(n³/3) - half the operations of LU decomposition.

The diagonal elements: Lⱼⱼ = √(Aⱼⱼ - Σₖ Lⱼₖ²)
Off-diagonal: Lᵢⱼ = (Aᵢⱼ - Σₖ Lᵢₖ Lⱼₖ) / Lⱼⱼ

Verified κ(L)² ≈ κ(A), confirming numerical stability bounds.

Notebook includes correlated random variable generation via x = μ + Lz where z ~ N(0, I).

**Title:** I implemented Cholesky decomposition from scratch - here's what I learned about efficient matrix factorization

**Body:**

Hey everyone! I just finished implementing the Cholesky decomposition algorithm and wanted to share what I learned.

**What is Cholesky Decomposition?**

It's a way to factor a symmetric positive-definite matrix A into A = LLᵀ, where L is a lower triangular matrix. Think of it like the "square root" of a matrix.

**Why should you care?**

1. **Speed**: It requires n³/3 floating-point operations vs 2n³/3 for LU decomposition - literally twice as fast
2. **Stability**: For positive-definite matrices, it's numerically well-behaved
3. **Applications**: Solving linear systems, Gaussian processes in ML, generating correlated random samples

**The Algorithm (ELI5)**

For each column j:
- Compute the diagonal: Lⱼⱼ = √(Aⱼⱼ - sum of squares of previous elements in row j)
- Compute below diagonal: subtract dot products and divide by diagonal

**Cool Finding**

I benchmarked it against LU decomposition for matrices from 50×50 to 1000×1000. Cholesky was consistently 1.5-2× faster!

**Practical Application**

The notebook includes generating correlated random variables. If you have a covariance matrix Σ and want samples from N(μ, Σ), just compute L from Σ = LLᵀ, then transform standard normal samples: x = μ + Lz

The condition number relationship κ(L)² ≈ κ(A) means solving via Cholesky is as stable as the problem allows.

Just explored one of my favorite algorithms: Cholesky decomposition!

It's a clever way to break down special matrices (symmetric positive-definite ones) into simpler pieces. The formula A = LLᵀ lets you solve equations twice as fast as standard methods.

Real-world uses: weather prediction, financial modeling, machine learning, and generating realistic correlated data for simulations.

The math is elegant and the Python implementation is surprisingly compact!

Sharing my latest computational notebook on Cholesky Decomposition - a fundamental algorithm in numerical linear algebra.

**Technical Overview**

The Cholesky factorization decomposes a symmetric positive-definite matrix A into A = LLᵀ, where L is lower triangular. This approach offers significant computational advantages:

- **Efficiency**: O(n³/3) operations vs O(2n³/3) for LU decomposition
- **Stability**: Condition number relationship κ(L)² ≈ κ(A) ensures numerical reliability
- **Memory**: Only the lower triangular portion requires storage

**Implementation Highlights**

- Built the algorithm from scratch using NumPy
- Validated against SciPy's optimized routines
- Benchmarked performance scaling from n=50 to n=1000
- Demonstrated application to correlated random variable generation

**Key Applications**

This technique is essential in:
- Solving large-scale linear systems
- Monte Carlo simulations requiring correlated samples
- Gaussian processes and Kalman filters in ML
- Optimization algorithms involving covariance matrices

The notebook includes complete Python code, performance visualizations, and numerical stability analysis.
