Why do markets crash fast but recover slow? The Heston model explains it: volatility itself is random and mean-reverting. Simulated 10,000 paths showing volatility clustering and fat tails.

Implemented the Heston stochastic volatility model in Python. Unlike Black-Scholes which assumes constant volatility, Heston treats volatility as a mean-reverting random process.

Key insight: negative correlation (ρ = -0.7) between price and volatility creates the leverage effect seen in real markets.

Ever wonder why stock market crashes are sudden but recoveries are slow?

The Heston model captures this through stochastic volatility. Instead of assuming constant volatility like Black-Scholes, it models volatility as a random process that:

- Clusters in time (volatile periods stay volatile)
- Reverts to a long-term mean
- Correlates negatively with price (leverage effect)

Ran 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations and the results show beautiful fat tails and volatility smiles just like real markets.

Implemented the Heston (1993) stochastic volatility model with Euler-Maruyama discretization.

The system of SDEs:
dS = μS dt + √v S dW^S
dv = κ(θ - v) dt + σ√v dW^v

Where dW^S·dW^v = ρ dt

Parameters: κ=2.0, θ=0.04, σ=0.3, ρ=-0.7

Results from 10,000 paths show:
- Negative skewness in returns (leverage effect)
- Excess kurtosis (fat tails)
- Volatility smile pattern

Feller condition 2κθ > σ² ensures variance stays positive.

**Title:** Implementing the Heston Stochastic Volatility Model in Python with Monte Carlo Simulation

**Body:**

I built a Python implementation of the Heston model for simulating asset prices with stochastic volatility. This is one of the most important models in quantitative finance because it addresses a major flaw in Black-Scholes: the assumption of constant volatility.

**What makes Heston special?**

The model treats volatility as its own random process that:
1. Mean-reverts to a long-term level θ
2. Has its own "volatility of volatility" σ
3. Correlates with asset returns (the leverage effect)

**The math (simplified):**

Price evolves as: dS = μS dt + √v S dW
Variance evolves as: dv = κ(θ - v) dt + σ√v dW

The key is that price and variance are correlated. In equity markets, ρ is typically negative (-0.5 to -0.9), meaning when prices drop, volatility spikes.

**What I learned:**

- The Feller condition (2κθ > σ²) keeps variance positive
- Euler-Maruyama with full truncation handles negative variance samples
- The model naturally produces volatility smiles and fat-tailed distributions

**Results from 10,000 paths:**
- Terminal returns show negative skew (left tail)
- Excess kurtosis of ~0.8 (fatter tails than normal)
- 99% VaR came out around -30%

The visualization shows price paths with volatility clustering, the variance mean-reverting to θ, and an implied volatility smile.

Why do stock markets crash suddenly but recover slowly?

I built a simulation of the Heston model - a mathematical framework that explains this asymmetry. Unlike simpler models, Heston treats market volatility as random and mean-reverting.

The key insight: when prices fall, volatility tends to spike (the "leverage effect"). This creates the fat-tailed distributions we see in real markets.

Ran 10,000 simulations in Python and the patterns match real market behavior beautifully.

Stochastic Volatility Modeling: Implementing Heston's Framework in Python

I recently completed an implementation of the Heston (1993) stochastic volatility model, a cornerstone of quantitative finance that addresses the constant volatility assumption in Black-Scholes.

Technical Implementation:
- Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 paths
- Euler-Maruyama discretization with full truncation scheme
- Correlated Wiener processes for price-volatility dynamics

Key Model Components:
- Mean reversion parameter κ = 2.0 (≈6 month half-life)
- Long-term variance θ = 0.04 (20% volatility)
- Vol-of-vol σ = 0.3
- Leverage correlation ρ = -0.7

Results and Validation:
The simulation successfully reproduces empirical market features:
- Negative skewness in returns (leverage effect)
- Excess kurtosis (fat tails)
- Implied volatility smile across strikes

Risk metrics including 99% VaR and CVaR were computed from the simulated distribution.

The Feller condition (2κθ > σ²) ensures variance remains positive throughout simulation.

This visualization shows the Heston stochastic volatility model in action.

Unlike Black-Scholes, Heston treats volatility as random. The negative correlation between price and volatility (ρ = -0.7) creates the leverage effect: prices drop → volatility spikes.
