Multigrid methods achieve O(N) complexity for solving PDEs - that's optimal!

While Gauss-Seidel struggles with low-frequency errors, multigrid exploits multiple grid resolutions to converge in just ~10 iterations.

Implemented a multigrid solver for the 2D Poisson equation.

The key insight: low-frequency errors on a fine grid appear as high-frequency on coarser grids - which relaxation methods handle efficiently.

Result: O(N) complexity vs O(N²) for classical iterative methods.

Just built a multigrid PDE solver from scratch and the results are beautiful!

The problem: Gauss-Seidel iteration is painfully slow for large grids because it can't eliminate low-frequency errors efficiently.

The solution: Use multiple grid resolutions! Coarse grids "see" smooth errors as oscillatory, making them easy to dampen.

My 64×64 grid converged in ~10 V-cycles while pure Gauss-Seidel was still grinding after 500 iterations.

This is why multigrid is the gold standard for elliptic PDEs.

Implemented a 2D multigrid V-cycle solver for the Poisson equation -∇²u = f.

Components:
→ Red-black Gauss-Seidel smoother
→ Full-weighting restriction (fine→coarse)
→ Bilinear interpolation prolongation (coarse→fine)

The convergence rate ρ ≈ 0.1 is grid-independent, giving O(N) total complexity.

Tested on u(x,y) = sin(πx)sin(πy) with second-order accuracy confirmed.

10 iterations vs 500+ for pure Gauss-Seidel on a 64×64 grid.

**Title:** I implemented a multigrid solver in Python - here's why it's 50x faster than basic iteration

**Body:**

I've been learning numerical methods and just finished implementing a multigrid solver for the 2D Poisson equation. The performance difference compared to classical methods blew my mind, so I wanted to share.

**The Problem**

When you discretize an elliptic PDE (like the Poisson equation -∇²u = f) on a grid, you get a huge sparse linear system. Classical iterative methods like Gauss-Seidel work, but they're painfully slow for large grids.

Why? They're great at smoothing out high-frequency (oscillatory) errors, but terrible at eliminating low-frequency (smooth) errors. The damping factor for low modes is nearly 1, so those errors barely shrink each iteration.

**The Multigrid Insight**

Here's the brilliant idea: what looks like a smooth, low-frequency error on a fine grid appears as an oscillatory, high-frequency error on a coarser grid!

So the algorithm does this (V-cycle):
1. Smooth the error on the fine grid (pre-smoothing)
2. Compute the residual r = f - Au
3. Restrict to a coarser grid
4. Solve/smooth on the coarse grid (recursively)
5. Interpolate the correction back to fine grid
6. Smooth again (post-smoothing)

**Results**

On a 64×64 grid:
- Multigrid: ~10 iterations to converge
- Gauss-Seidel: 500+ iterations and still not there

The best part? The convergence rate is independent of grid size. Whether you have 16×16 or 128×128 points, multigrid converges in roughly the same number of iterations. That's O(N) total complexity!

**What I Learned**

- Grid transfer operators matter: full-weighting restriction and bilinear interpolation preserve accuracy
- Red-black Gauss-Seidel ordering is more efficient than lexicographic
- The coarse grid doesn't need to be solved exactly - a few smoothing sweeps work fine

Just wrote a multigrid solver for partial differential equations and I'm amazed by the results!

The classic approach (Gauss-Seidel) needed 500+ iterations on my test problem. Multigrid? Just 10.

The trick: problems that look "hard" on a fine grid become "easy" on a coarser grid. By bouncing between resolutions, you solve in optimal O(N) time.

This is real computational science - the algorithms powering everything from weather prediction to video game physics.

Implemented a multigrid solver for 2D elliptic PDEs - demonstrating why this method is the gold standard in scientific computing.

**Technical Approach:**
• Discretized the Poisson equation using 5-point finite differences
• Built a V-cycle multigrid with red-black Gauss-Seidel smoothing
• Implemented full-weighting restriction and bilinear interpolation operators

**Key Results:**
• Grid-independent convergence rate (ρ ≈ 0.1)
• O(N) computational complexity vs O(N²) for classical methods
• 10 iterations vs 500+ for Gauss-Seidel on equivalent problems
• Verified second-order spatial accuracy

**Why This Matters:**
Multigrid methods underpin modern computational tools in CFD, structural analysis, and electromagnetic simulation. Understanding these algorithms is essential for anyone working with large-scale numerical models.

The core insight - that smooth errors become oscillatory on coarser grids - is elegant and generalizes to many problem classes.

Skills demonstrated: numerical analysis, algorithm implementation, scientific Python, PDE theory.

Multigrid magic ✨

This plot shows why multigrid methods are incredible for solving PDEs.

Top left: Multigrid (blue) converges in ~10 iterations. Gauss-Seidel (red) is still grinding after 500.

Top right: The convergence rate is the same regardless of grid size. That's O(N) complexity!

Bottom left: Second-order accuracy confirmed.

Bottom right: The solution to -∇²u = 2π²sin(πx)sin(πy).

The secret? Low-frequency errors on fine grids become high-frequency on coarse grids - easy to eliminate.
