Why doesn't a compass work the same everywhere on Earth? It's holonomy! Transport a vector around a sphere and it rotates by the enclosed area. Math meets navigation.

Parallel transport reveals something profound: on curved surfaces, there's no global notion of "parallel." A vector transported around a closed loop rotates - the holonomy angle equals the integrated Gaussian curvature.

Demonstrated with Python on a unit sphere.

Here's a mind-bending geometry fact: if you carry a pointer around a triangle on a sphere, it won't point the same direction when you return!

This is called holonomy, and the rotation angle equals the "spherical excess" - how much the triangle's angles exceed 180 degrees.

On a flat surface? Zero rotation. On a sphere? The rotation reveals the curvature you walked around.

Built a Python simulation proving the theory matches computation perfectly.

Implemented parallel transport on S² using the Levi-Civita connection.

Key insight: The ODE system dV^k/dt + Gamma^k_ij (dx^i/dt) V^j = 0 governs how vectors evolve along curves.

For a spherical triangle with vertex at pole and two equator points at phi=0 and phi=pi/2:
- Expected holonomy: pi/2 rad (90 deg)
- Computed: matches within numerical precision

The Gauss-Bonnet theorem in action!

Title: I built a Python simulation of parallel transport on a sphere - and proved holonomy matches curvature theory!

Body:

**What is parallel transport?**

Imagine you're standing at the North Pole holding an arrow pointing toward New York. You walk to the equator (arrow still points the same direction relative to you), walk 1/4 around the equator, then return to the pole.

Here's the weird part: your arrow is now pointing a different direction than when you started - even though you never rotated it!

**Why does this happen?**

On curved surfaces, "parallel" has no global meaning. The best we can do is keep a vector "as parallel as possible" locally, which is formalized by the covariant derivative: nabla_gamma'(t) V(t) = 0

The rotation after a closed loop is called holonomy, and it directly measures the curvature enclosed by your path.

**The math checks out**

For a spherical triangle with:
- One vertex at the pole
- Two vertices on the equator at phi = 0 and phi = pi/2

The spherical excess is exactly pi/2 (angles sum to 270 deg instead of 180 deg), and my simulation computed holonomy of 90 degrees - matching theory!

**Code highlights:**
- Used scipy.integrate.odeint for the parallel transport ODEs
- Christoffel symbols: Gamma^theta_phi_phi = -sin(theta)cos(theta), Gamma^phi_theta_phi = cot(theta)
- 3D visualization with matplotlib

This connects to Einstein's general relativity (spacetime curvature), quantum mechanics (Berry phase), and even robotics!

Ever wonder what happens when you walk around a triangle on Earth while keeping a compass needle "parallel"? It doesn't point the same way when you return!

This is called holonomy - and it's how mathematicians detect curvature. I built a Python simulation demonstrating this on a sphere.

The rotation angle exactly equals the area enclosed - a beautiful connection between algebra and geometry called the Gauss-Bonnet theorem.

Exploring Differential Geometry Through Computational Methods

I recently completed a project implementing parallel transport on curved surfaces - a fundamental concept from differential geometry with applications in general relativity, robotics, and machine learning.

The Challenge:
On curved manifolds, there's no global notion of "parallel." Vectors must be transported using the Levi-Civita connection, governed by the equation:
dV^k/dt + Gamma^k_ij (dx^i/dt) V^j = 0

The Implementation:
- Derived Christoffel symbols for the 2-sphere
- Implemented ODE integration using scipy
- Created 3D visualizations demonstrating holonomy
- Verified results against Gauss-Bonnet theorem predictions

Key Result:
A vector transported around a spherical triangle (pole + two equator points) rotates by exactly the spherical excess - confirming the deep connection between local geometry and global topology.

Skills demonstrated: Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, differential geometry, scientific computing, mathematical physics.

Parallel Transport on a Sphere

Walk a triangle on Earth holding an arrow "parallel" - when you return, it points a different direction!

This is holonomy, and it reveals the curvature you enclosed.

My simulation shows:
- Blue path: triangular route on sphere
- Green arrow: starting direction
- Red arrow: direction after one loop
- Rotation = 90 degrees = spherical excess

The Gauss-Bonnet theorem connects local geometry to global topology.
