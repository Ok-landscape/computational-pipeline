Simulated 6 particles bouncing in a box - both momentum AND kinetic energy stay perfectly conserved!

The math: v₁f = [(m₁-m₂)v₁ᵢ + 2m₂v₂ᵢ]/(m₁+m₂)

Physics is beautiful when the numbers work out.

Built an elastic collision simulation in Python. Six particles with different masses bouncing around, and the conservation laws hold perfectly:

- Total kinetic energy: constant
- Total momentum (pₓ, pᵧ): conserved

When coefficient of restitution e=1, the math just works.

Just built something cool: an elastic collision simulator!

Imagine 6 balls of different sizes bouncing around in a box. In physics, "elastic" means both momentum AND kinetic energy are conserved.

The key formula: v₁f = [(m₁-m₂)v₁ᵢ + 2m₂v₂ᵢ]/(m₁+m₂)

When you run the sim for 15 seconds with 3000 time steps, the energy stays rock solid. That's the beautiful thing about physics - when you code the equations right, conservation laws emerge naturally.

Implemented a 2D elastic collision simulation with 6 particles. The physics is satisfying:

Conservation of momentum: m₁v₁ᵢ + m₂v₂ᵢ = m₁v₁f + m₂v₂f
Conservation of KE: ½m₁v₁ᵢ² + ½m₂v₂ᵢ² = ½m₁v₁f² + ½m₂v₂f²

For 2D collisions, decompose velocity along collision normal n̂ and tangent t̂. Normal components exchange per 1D formulas; tangential components unchanged.

Coefficient of restitution e=1 for perfect elasticity.

**Title:** I built an elastic collision simulator in Python - here's what I learned about conservation laws

**Body:**

Hey everyone! I just finished building a 2D elastic collision simulator and wanted to share what I learned.

**The Physics**

An elastic collision conserves both momentum and kinetic energy. The key equations are:

- Momentum: m₁v₁ᵢ + m₂v₂ᵢ = m₁v₁f + m₂v₂f
- Kinetic Energy: ½m₁v₁² + ½m₂v₂² = constant

For 1D collisions, solving these gives:
- v₁f = [(m₁-m₂)v₁ᵢ + 2m₂v₂ᵢ]/(m₁+m₂)
- v₂f = [(m₂-m₁)v₂ᵢ + 2m₁v₁ᵢ]/(m₁+m₂)

**The Cool Part**

For 2D collisions, you decompose velocities along the collision normal (line between centers) and tangent. The normal components follow the 1D formulas, while tangential components stay unchanged. This is why billiard balls behave the way they do!

**Results**

I simulated 6 particles with different masses (0.8 to 2.0 kg) bouncing around for 15 seconds. The results verified:
- Kinetic energy stayed constant throughout
- Both x and y momentum components were conserved
- Coefficient of restitution e=1 (perfectly elastic)

**What I Learned**

1. Heavier particles transfer more momentum during collisions
2. Equal-mass particles swap velocities along the collision normal
3. Small numerical errors can accumulate, so use small time steps (dt=0.005s worked well)

Happy to answer questions about the implementation!

Just built something fun: a physics simulation of balls bouncing around and colliding!

The cool thing about "elastic" collisions is that energy is perfectly conserved - nothing is lost to heat or deformation. When you code the equations correctly, you can watch 6 different particles bounce around for 15 seconds and the total energy stays exactly the same.

It's like a perfect game of pool that never stops.

Computational Physics Project: Elastic Collision Simulation

I recently completed a Python simulation demonstrating fundamental conservation laws in mechanics.

**Technical Approach:**
- Implemented 2D elastic collisions using vector decomposition along collision normals
- Used impulse-based collision resolution: J = 2(Δv·n̂)/(1/m₁ + 1/m₂)
- Time-stepped integration with dt=0.005s over 15 seconds (3000 iterations)

**Key Results:**
The simulation verified conservation of both kinetic energy (KE = ½mv²) and momentum (p = mv) to high precision. Six particles with varying masses (0.8-2.0 kg) demonstrated expected behavior including velocity exchange between equal-mass particles.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Object-oriented design (Particle class with encapsulated physics)
- Numerical methods and time-stepping algorithms
- Data visualization with matplotlib
- Physics simulation and validation

This project reinforces how computational tools can verify theoretical predictions and provide intuition about physical systems.

Physics in action

Six particles.
Different masses.
Bouncing around in a box.

The beautiful thing? Both momentum AND energy stay perfectly conserved.

That's what "elastic" means in physics - no energy lost, just transferred.

The math:
v₁f = [(m₁-m₂)v₁ᵢ + 2m₂v₂ᵢ]/(m₁+m₂)

Built this simulation in Python to visualize what happens when the equations are right - the conservation laws emerge naturally.

Plot shows particle trajectories + energy/momentum over time.
