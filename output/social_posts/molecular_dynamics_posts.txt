Ever wonder how scientists simulate atoms moving around? I just built a molecular dynamics simulator!

The idea: give each particle a position and velocity, then let Newton's laws take over. Forces come from the Lennard-Jones potential - particles attract at distance but repel when too close.

Used the Velocity Verlet algorithm for integration (it's symplectic, so energy stays conserved). Started 36 particles on a lattice, now they're bouncing around like a real fluid!

Built a 2D molecular dynamics simulation in Python using the Velocity Verlet integrator.

Key physics:
- Lennard-Jones potential: U(r) = 4ε[(σ/r)¹² - (σ/r)⁶]
- Periodic boundary conditions for bulk behavior
- Temperature from equipartition: T = 2Eₖ/(3Nkᵦ)

Results show excellent energy conservation (<0.01% drift over 5000 steps). The symplectic nature of Verlet really shines here.

Code uses reduced units (ε=σ=m=1) for generality.

TITLE: I built a molecular dynamics simulation from scratch - here's how it works

BODY:

**What is Molecular Dynamics?**

MD simulates atoms/molecules by numerically solving Newton's equations of motion. Think of it as a virtual chemistry set where you can watch particles bounce around and measure thermodynamic properties.

**The Physics (ELI5 version)**

Imagine you have marbles that:
- Push each other away when too close (like magnets repelling)
- Gently pull toward each other at medium distance
- Don't interact when far apart

That's the Lennard-Jones potential! The force looks like: F ∝ 24ε[2(σ/r)¹² - (σ/r)⁶]

**How the Simulation Works**

1. Place particles on a grid
2. Give them random velocities (Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution)
3. Calculate forces between all pairs
4. Update positions and velocities using Velocity Verlet algorithm
5. Repeat thousands of times

**Why Velocity Verlet?**

It's "symplectic" - meaning it preserves phase space volume. Translation: energy stays conserved over long simulations. My 5000-step run had <0.01% energy drift!

**Cool Results**

- Started with particles in a lattice → ended with fluid-like disorder
- Temperature fluctuates around target (as expected for NVE ensemble)
- The interplay between kinetic and potential energy is mesmerizing

**What I learned:** Even "simple" physics simulations involve careful numerical methods. The choice of integrator, time step, and boundary conditions all matter enormously.

Ever wondered how scientists simulate what happens at the atomic level?

I just built a molecular dynamics simulation - basically a virtual box of particles that follow Newton's laws! You give them starting positions and velocities, and physics does the rest.

The particles attract and repel each other following the Lennard-Jones potential (the same physics that explains why gases become liquids when cooled).

Watch them evolve from an orderly grid into chaotic motion - it's mesmerizing!

Computational Physics in Action: Building a Molecular Dynamics Simulator

I recently implemented a 2D molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to deepen my understanding of computational methods in physics.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Lennard-Jones potential for pairwise interactions
- Velocity Verlet integration (symplectic algorithm for energy conservation)
- Periodic boundary conditions to simulate bulk behavior
- Reduced units for generality across atomic species

**Key Skills Demonstrated:**
- Numerical methods and algorithm implementation
- Scientific computing with NumPy
- Data visualization with Matplotlib
- Understanding of statistical mechanics

**Results:**
The simulation achieved excellent energy conservation (<0.01% drift over 5000 time steps), validating the numerical approach. Temperature fluctuations followed expected behavior for the microcanonical ensemble.

**Why This Matters:**
MD simulations are foundational in drug discovery, materials science, and chemical engineering. Understanding these methods from first principles provides insight into how computational tools drive modern research.
