Just simulated Bell's inequality violation with Python! Quantum mechanics gives S ≈ 2√2 ≈ 2.83, smashing the classical limit of 2. Einstein's "spooky action" is REAL.

Simulated the CHSH test for Bell inequality violations in Python. Quantum correlations reach S ≈ 2.83, exceeding the classical bound of |S| ≤ 2. This rules out local hidden variable theories and confirms quantum entanglement as genuine.

Ever wonder if Einstein was right about quantum mechanics being "incomplete"?

I just coded a simulation of Bell's inequality test - the experiment that settles the debate.

Results: Quantum mechanics predicts S = 2√2 ≈ 2.83
Classical physics maxes out at S = 2

The simulation confirms it: entangled particles show correlations that NO classical theory can explain. Spooky action at a distance is real!

Implemented a CHSH test simulation in Python to demonstrate Bell inequality violations.

Key results:
- Quantum correlation: E(a,b) = -cos(θ)
- CHSH parameter: S_QM ≈ 2√2 ≈ 2.828
- Classical bound: |S| ≤ 2

Using optimal angles (a=0°, a'=90°, b=45°, b'=135°), the simulation shows statistically significant violation of the classical bound, ruling out local hidden variable theories.

Bootstrap CI and z-scores included for rigorous statistical validation.

Title: I built a Python simulation that proves Einstein wrong about quantum mechanics

Body:

**TL;DR:** Simulated Bell's inequality test showing quantum entanglement produces correlations impossible under classical physics.

**The Background:**

In 1935, Einstein argued quantum mechanics was incomplete - surely "hidden variables" must explain those weird correlations without "spooky action at a distance." In 1964, John Bell proved we could actually TEST this with a mathematical inequality.

**What I Built:**

A Python simulation comparing:
1. **Quantum mechanical model** - Entangled singlet state |ψ⁻⟩ = (1/√2)(|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)
2. **Local hidden variable model** - Classical particles with predetermined outcomes

**The Test (CHSH Inequality):**

Measure the parameter S = E(a,b) - E(a,b') + E(a',b) + E(a',b')

- Classical physics: |S| ≤ 2 (always)
- Quantum mechanics: S = 2√2 ≈ 2.828 (at optimal angles)

**Results:**

With 100,000 trials, the quantum simulation gives S ≈ 2.82 with p-value < 0.001. The classical bound is violated with overwhelming statistical significance.

**What I Learned:**

- The triangular correlation function for LHV models vs sinusoidal for QM
- Why specific angles (0°, 45°, 90°, 135°) maximize the violation
- Bootstrap methods for confidence intervals in physics simulations

This is the same test that won the 2022 Nobel Prize (Aspect, Clauser, Zeilinger)!

Did you know we can mathematically PROVE that quantum entanglement is real?

I built a simulation of Bell's inequality test - the famous experiment that settled the debate between Einstein and quantum physicists.

The result: entangled particles show correlations (S ≈ 2.83) that exceed what's possible in classical physics (S ≤ 2).

Einstein called it "spooky action at a distance." Turns out, it's just how the universe works!

**Simulating Quantum Foundations: A Bell Inequality Implementation**

I recently completed a computational project implementing the CHSH test for Bell inequality violations - the foundational experiment in quantum information science that earned the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Monte Carlo simulation of entangled singlet state measurements
- Comparison between quantum mechanical and local hidden variable models
- Statistical validation using bootstrap confidence intervals and hypothesis testing
- Visualization of correlation functions and parameter distributions

**Key Results:**
The quantum simulation achieves S ≈ 2.83, significantly exceeding the classical bound of |S| ≤ 2 (p < 0.001). This demonstrates the statistical methodology for confirming quantum nonlocality.

**Skills Applied:**
NumPy for numerical simulation, Matplotlib for scientific visualization, SciPy for statistical analysis, and rigorous hypothesis testing methodology.

This project bridges theoretical physics with practical data science - exactly the kind of interdisciplinary work that drives quantum technology forward.

quantum physics is WILD

just built a simulation proving that entangled particles communicate faster than light should allow

the math:
quantum prediction: S = 2√2 ≈ 2.83
classical maximum: S = 2

my simulation: S = 2.82 ✓

this is the exact test that won the 2022 Nobel Prize

einstein called it "spooky action at a distance" and thought it proved quantum mechanics was wrong

turns out... einstein was wrong. entanglement is real.
