Ever wonder how nature divides space? Voronoi diagrams partition a plane so every point is closest to its generator. Built one in Python using Fortune's O(n log n) algorithm!

Explored Voronoi diagrams today - elegant structures that partition space based on proximity to seed points. Each cell V(pᵢ) contains all points closest to pᵢ. Implemented Fortune's sweep line algorithm in Python with SciPy. The Voronoi-Delaunay duality is particularly beautiful.

Just built Voronoi diagrams from scratch in Python!

These mathematical structures divide space into regions where each point is closest to its "seed." Think of it like: if you dropped 20 coffee shops in a city, the Voronoi diagram shows which areas each shop would serve.

Key insight: Voronoi diagrams are dual to Delaunay triangulations - flip between them and you get two fundamental geometric structures.

Used SciPy's Fortune algorithm: O(n log n) complexity. Verified the nearest-neighbor property with 5000 test points!

Implemented Voronoi diagram construction using scipy.spatial.Voronoi (Fortune's algorithm).

Mathematical definition: V(pᵢ) = {x ∈ ℝ² : ‖x - pᵢ‖ ≤ ‖x - pⱼ‖ for all j ≠ i}

Key properties explored:
• Cells are convex polygons
• Boundaries lie on perpendicular bisectors
• Vertices are equidistant from ≥3 generators
• Dual to Delaunay triangulation

Complexity: O(n log n)

Tested with random, clustered, and perturbed grid point distributions.

**Title:** Built Voronoi diagrams in Python - here's the math and code explained

**Body:**

Just finished a notebook exploring Voronoi diagram construction and wanted to share what I learned!

**What's a Voronoi diagram?**

Imagine dropping 20 coffee shops randomly in a city. A Voronoi diagram divides the city so that every location belongs to its nearest coffee shop. Mathematically, each cell V(pᵢ) contains all points x where the distance ‖x - pᵢ‖ is less than or equal to the distance to any other generator point.

**Cool properties I discovered:**

1. Every Voronoi cell is a convex polygon
2. Cell boundaries lie on perpendicular bisectors between neighboring points
3. Voronoi vertices are equidistant from at least 3 generator points
4. There's a beautiful duality with Delaunay triangulations - they're essentially "flipped" versions of each other

**Implementation:**

Used `scipy.spatial.Voronoi` which implements Fortune's sweep line algorithm with O(n log n) complexity. The tricky part was handling infinite regions at the boundaries - had to write a custom function to clip them to finite polygons.

**Results:**

- Tested with random points, clustered distributions, and perturbed grids
- Average cell had about 5-6 edges
- Verified the nearest-neighbor property with 5000 random test points: 100% accuracy

**Real-world applications:**

- Spatial analysis and nearest neighbor queries
- Computer graphics (texture synthesis, mesh generation)
- Crystallography (Wigner-Seitz cells)
- Robotics path planning

How does nature divide space? Voronoi diagrams have the answer!

These beautiful mathematical structures partition a plane so that every point belongs to its nearest "seed." You see them everywhere - giraffe spots, dragonfly wings, even the pattern of bubbles in foam.

I built one in Python today, testing random points, clusters, and grid patterns. The algorithm runs in O(n log n) time - surprisingly fast!

Exploring Computational Geometry: Voronoi Diagram Construction

Today I implemented Voronoi diagrams in Python, demonstrating key computational geometry concepts and their real-world applications.

**Technical Approach:**

Used SciPy's implementation of Fortune's sweep line algorithm, achieving O(n log n) time complexity. The notebook covers:

• Mathematical foundations (formal definition, convexity properties, perpendicular bisector relationships)
• Multiple point distributions (random, clustered, perturbed grid)
• Custom visualization with finite polygon clipping for bounded regions
• Voronoi-Delaunay duality demonstration
• Geometric analysis (area, perimeter, edge count statistics)
• Verification of the fundamental nearest-neighbor property

**Applications:**

Voronoi diagrams are fundamental in spatial analysis, computer graphics, crystallography, epidemiology, and robotics path planning. Understanding these structures is essential for anyone working with proximity queries or spatial partitioning.

**Skills demonstrated:** Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, computational geometry, algorithm analysis

Voronoi diagrams: where math meets art

These structures partition space so every point belongs to its nearest seed. Nature uses them everywhere - giraffe patterns, leaf cells, bubble foam.
