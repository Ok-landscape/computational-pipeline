Why do soap films form perfect shapes? They're MINIMAL SURFACES — surfaces with zero mean curvature (H = 0) that minimize area naturally.

Minimal surfaces: where math meets physics meets beauty.

These surfaces have zero mean curvature H = ½(κ₁ + κ₂) = 0, meaning they locally minimize area. Soap films naturally form them!

Explored 3 classic examples: catenoid, helicoid, and Enneper's surface with Python visualization.

Ever wonder why soap bubbles and films form such elegant shapes?

They're called minimal surfaces — surfaces that minimize their area, characterized by zero mean curvature at every point.

I coded up three classical examples in Python:
• Catenoid — rotate a catenary curve
• Helicoid — a twisted ruled surface
• Enneper's surface — a beautiful self-intersecting form

The math: H = ½(κ₁ + κ₂) = 0

Verified numerically that mean curvature ≈ 0 for all three! Pretty satisfying when the theory checks out.

Implemented visualization & numerical verification of classical minimal surfaces in Python.

Minimal surfaces satisfy H = 0, where mean curvature H = (eG - 2fF + gE) / 2(EG - F²) using the first & second fundamental forms.

Surfaces explored:
• Catenoid: r(u,v) = (c·cosh(v/c)·cos(u), c·cosh(v/c)·sin(u), v)
• Helicoid: r(u,v) = (v·cos(u), v·sin(u), cu)
• Enneper's surface

Numerical verification confirms |H| ≈ 10⁻⁶ for all three.

**Title:** I visualized minimal surfaces in Python and verified their zero mean curvature numerically

**Body:**

Hey everyone! I just finished a notebook exploring **minimal surfaces** — these are surfaces that locally minimize their area, like soap films stretched across wire frames.

**ELI5 version:** Imagine dipping a bent wire into soapy water. The soap film that forms naturally takes the shape that uses the least amount of "soap" (minimum area). Mathematically, this happens when something called the "mean curvature" equals zero at every point.

**What I learned:**

The mean curvature H is defined as:
- H = ½(κ₁ + κ₂)
- Where κ₁ and κ₂ are the principal curvatures

For a surface z = f(x,y), the minimal surface equation is a gnarly nonlinear PDE:
- (1 + f_y²)f_xx - 2f_x·f_y·f_xy + (1 + f_x²)f_yy = 0

**Three classical examples I visualized:**

1. **Catenoid** — The only minimal surface of revolution (besides a plane). It's what you get rotating a catenary curve.

2. **Helicoid** — A twisted surface like a spiral staircase. Fun fact: it's the only ruled minimal surface besides the plane!

3. **Enneper's Surface** — A beautiful self-intersecting surface with a saddle-like shape.

**The cool part:** I wrote a function to numerically compute mean curvature using the first and second fundamental forms, and verified that |H| ≈ 10⁻⁶ for all three surfaces. Theory confirmed!

**Real-world applications:**
- Architecture (tensile structures like the Munich Olympic Stadium roof)
- Materials science (block copolymer structures)
- Biology (cell membranes)

Would love to hear if anyone has worked with other minimal surfaces or has suggestions for improvements!

Ever noticed how soap films form such perfect, elegant shapes?

That's because they're "minimal surfaces" — surfaces that naturally minimize their area, with zero mean curvature at every point.

I visualized three classic examples:
🌀 Catenoid (rotating catenary)
🔄 Helicoid (spiral surface)
🎨 Enneper's surface (self-intersecting beauty)

These shapes appear everywhere from architecture to biology!

Exploring the Mathematics of Minimal Surfaces with Python

I recently completed a computational exploration of minimal surfaces — a fascinating topic at the intersection of differential geometry, physics, and computational methods.

Key concepts covered:
• Mean curvature H = ½(κ₁ + κ₂) and the condition H = 0 for minimality
• First and second fundamental forms for surface analysis
• The nonlinear PDE governing minimal surfaces

Implementation highlights:
• Parametric visualization of three classical minimal surfaces (catenoid, helicoid, Enneper's surface) using NumPy and Matplotlib
• Numerical verification algorithm computing mean curvature from discrete surface data
• Achieved numerical precision of |H| ≈ 10⁻⁶, confirming theoretical predictions

These surfaces have practical applications in architecture (tensile membrane structures), materials science (triply periodic minimal surfaces in polymers), and biological systems.

The mathematics of soap films ✨

These are MINIMAL SURFACES — shapes that naturally minimize their area.

What you're seeing:
🔹 Catenoid (left) — rotated catenary curve
🔹 Helicoid (center) — spiral ruled surface
🔹 Enneper's surface (right) — self-intersecting beauty

The defining property?
Zero mean curvature: H = 0

Soap films find these shapes automatically because surface tension minimizes energy (area).
