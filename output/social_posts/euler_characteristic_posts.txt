Why do ALL shapes have something in common? Euler's formula: V - E + F = 2 for any convex polyhedron! Vertices minus edges plus faces always equals 2. Math magic that connects cubes, pyramids & soccer balls.

The Euler characteristic (chi) is topology's superpower. For any convex polyhedron: chi = V - E + F = 2. Tetrahedron? 4 - 6 + 4 = 2. Icosahedron? 12 - 30 + 20 = 2. This 1758 discovery by Leonhard Euler still shapes modern mathematics.

Here's a mind-bending math fact:

Take ANY convex 3D shape. Count its vertices (V), edges (E), and faces (F).

Now calculate: V - E + F

The answer? Always 2.

Cube: 8 - 12 + 6 = 2
Pyramid: 4 - 6 + 4 = 2
Icosahedron: 12 - 30 + 20 = 2

Euler discovered this in 1758. It's called the Euler characteristic (chi), and it's one of topology's most powerful invariants.

Built a Python notebook exploring this with visualizations!

Explored the Euler characteristic chi in a computational notebook. Key insights:

- For polyhedra: chi = V - E + F = 2
- From Betti numbers: chi = sum of (-1)^i * b_i
- Orientable surfaces: chi = 2 - 2g (g = genus)
- Gauss-Bonnet theorem: integral of K dA = 2*pi*chi

Verified all 5 Platonic solids give chi = 2. Also demonstrated the product formula: chi(X x Y) = chi(X) * chi(Y).

Python + numpy + matplotlib for computational topology.

Title: I built a Python notebook exploring the Euler Characteristic - one of topology's most elegant invariants

Body:

**What is the Euler Characteristic?**

Ever notice something strange about 3D shapes? Take any convex polyhedron, count its vertices (V), edges (E), and faces (F), and calculate V - E + F. You always get 2!

- Cube: 8 - 12 + 6 = 2
- Tetrahedron: 4 - 6 + 4 = 2
- Icosahedron: 12 - 30 + 20 = 2

This number is called the Euler characteristic (chi), discovered by Leonhard Euler in 1758.

**Why does this matter?**

The Euler characteristic is a *topological invariant* - it doesn't change when you stretch, bend, or deform a shape (without tearing or gluing). This makes it incredibly powerful for classifying surfaces:

- Sphere: chi = 2
- Torus (donut): chi = 0
- Double torus: chi = -2

For orientable surfaces, you can even calculate the genus (number of holes): g = (2 - chi) / 2

**What's in the notebook?**

- Verification of Euler's formula for all 5 Platonic solids
- Computing chi from Betti numbers (homology approach)
- 3D visualizations of triangulated polyhedra
- Demonstration of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem
- Product formula verification: chi(X x Y) = chi(X) * chi(Y)

**Cool connection:** The Gauss-Bonnet theorem links the Euler characteristic to geometry. For any closed surface, the integral of Gaussian curvature equals 2*pi*chi. This means topology constrains geometry!

Math can be beautiful AND surprising!

Here's Euler's amazing discovery from 1758: Take ANY 3D shape with flat faces. Count its corners (vertices), edges, and faces. Then calculate:

Vertices - Edges + Faces = ?

The answer is ALWAYS 2. Every time. Cube, pyramid, soccer ball shape - doesn't matter!

This "Euler characteristic" is fundamental to topology, the study of shapes. Built a Python notebook exploring this with visualizations.

Exploring Computational Topology: The Euler Characteristic

Recently completed a computational exploration of one of mathematics' most elegant invariants - the Euler characteristic.

Key technical highlights:

**Mathematical Foundation**
The Euler characteristic (chi) satisfies chi = V - E + F for polyhedra. More generally, it can be computed from Betti numbers: chi = sum of (-1)^i * b_i, connecting combinatorics to algebraic topology.

**Implementation Approach**
- Python functions for computing chi from vertices/edges/faces and from Betti numbers
- Triangulation verification for closed surfaces
- 3D visualization using matplotlib
- Numerical validation of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem

**Key Findings Verified**
- All 5 Platonic solids have chi = 2
- Product formula: chi(X x Y) = chi(X) * chi(Y)
- Genus relationship: g = (2 - chi) / 2 for orientable surfaces

This project demonstrates the intersection of pure mathematics and computational methods - using code to verify and visualize abstract topological concepts.

The geometry of everything.

Euler discovered in 1758 that every convex polyhedron follows one rule:

Vertices - Edges + Faces = 2

Always.

Tetrahedron: 4 - 6 + 4 = 2
Cube: 8 - 12 + 6 = 2
Icosahedron: 12 - 30 + 20 = 2

This "Euler characteristic" reveals deep connections between shape, holes, and curvature.

Visualization shows how different surfaces (sphere, torus, etc.) each have their own characteristic number.

Math is visual. Math is beautiful.
