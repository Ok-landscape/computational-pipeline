The Chua circuit is the simplest electronic system exhibiting chaos. With just 2 capacitors, 1 inductor, 1 resistor, and a nonlinear diode, it generates the beautiful double scroll attractor. Our simulation shows how a 0.0001 change in initial conditions leads to completely different trajectories.

Ever wonder what chaos looks like in electronics? The Chua circuit is literally the simplest possible circuit that can be chaotic.

It has just 5 components, but produces this wild double scroll attractor pattern. The coolest part? Change the starting voltage by just 0.0001 and you get a completely different outcome. That's the butterfly effect in action!

Built with Python using scipy's ODE solver. The bifurcation diagram shows exactly how the system transitions from order to chaos.

Simulated the Chua circuit - a canonical example of electronic chaos.

System equations:
dx/dτ = α[y - x - f(x)]
dy/dτ = x - y + z
dz/dτ = -βy

Where f(x) is the piecewise-linear Chua diode characteristic with slopes m₀ ≈ -8/7 and m₁ ≈ -5/7.

With α = 15.6, β = 28, the system produces the double scroll attractor. Estimated largest Lyapunov exponent λ₁ ≈ 0.3 confirms chaotic dynamics. A perturbation of 10⁻⁴ amplifies by ~1000x over τ = 50.

**Title:** Simulating Chaos: The Chua Circuit Double Scroll Attractor in Python

**Body:**

**What is the Chua Circuit?**

The Chua circuit, designed in 1983, is the simplest electronic circuit that exhibits chaotic behavior. It uses just 5 components: 2 capacitors, 1 inductor, 1 resistor, and a special nonlinear element called Chua's diode.

**Why does it matter?**

It's become the "fruit fly" of chaos research - simple enough to study, yet rich enough to show all the hallmarks of chaotic systems:
- Strange attractors
- Sensitive dependence on initial conditions
- Period-doubling route to chaos

**The Math (simplified)**

The system is described by three coupled differential equations. In dimensionless form:

dx/dτ = α[y - x - f(x)]
dy/dτ = x - y + z
dz/dτ = -βy

The nonlinearity f(x) is a piecewise-linear function that acts like a negative resistance in certain voltage ranges.

**What I learned:**

1. **Sensitivity is real** - Changing initial x from 0.7 to 0.7001 (0.01% difference) leads to trajectories that diverge by 1000x after just τ = 50

2. **Bifurcation diagrams are beautiful** - As you vary α from 8 to 16, you can see the system go from periodic orbits → period doubling → full chaos

3. **Lyapunov exponents quantify chaos** - A positive largest Lyapunov exponent (≈ 0.3 for standard parameters) mathematically confirms exponential divergence

**Code highlights:**

Used `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` with RK45 method and tight tolerances (rtol=10⁻⁸) to accurately capture the chaotic dynamics. The piecewise Chua diode function uses absolute values for a vectorized implementation.

This is what chaos looks like! The Chua circuit is the simplest electronic circuit that produces genuinely unpredictable behavior - just 5 basic components creating this mesmerizing double scroll pattern.

The wildest part? If you change the starting conditions by just 0.01%, you get a completely different outcome. That's the butterfly effect, and this circuit demonstrates it perfectly.

Computational Modeling of Chaotic Systems: The Chua Circuit

I recently completed a numerical simulation of the Chua circuit - a canonical example of deterministic chaos in electronic systems.

Key Technical Aspects:
• Implemented the three coupled ODEs governing circuit dynamics
• Used scipy's solve_ivp with adaptive RK45 method and high-precision tolerances (rtol=10⁻⁸, atol=10⁻¹⁰)
• Generated bifurcation diagrams showing the period-doubling route to chaos
• Estimated the largest Lyapunov exponent (λ₁ ≈ 0.3) to quantify chaotic dynamics

Skills Demonstrated:
• Numerical integration of stiff nonlinear ODEs
• Scientific visualization with matplotlib (3D phase portraits, projections, bifurcation diagrams)
• Analysis of dynamical systems (fixed points, stability, Lyapunov exponents)

The simulation reveals how a perturbation of just 10⁻⁴ in initial conditions amplifies by three orders of magnitude, demonstrating the practical implications of sensitive dependence in control systems.

The simplest chaos machine

This is the double scroll attractor from a Chua circuit - just 5 electronic components creating pure mathematical chaos.

What you're seeing is a system that's completely deterministic (no randomness!) yet impossible to predict long-term.

Change the starting point by 0.01%?
Completely different outcome.

That's the butterfly effect, visualized.
