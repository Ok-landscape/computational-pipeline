Just implemented the Newton-Raphson method and the convergence is beautiful!

Starting from x=1.0 to find √2:
- Iteration 0: 1.0
- Iteration 1: 1.5
- Iteration 2: 1.416666...
- Iteration 3: 1.414215...
- Iteration 4: 1.41421356...

That's quadratic convergence - each step roughly doubles your accuracy!

The geometric interpretation is elegant: find where the tangent line crosses the x-axis, repeat.

Fun fact: This formula for square roots is the ancient Babylonian method!

Implemented the Newton-Raphson root-finding algorithm with full convergence analysis.

Key formula: x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n)/f'(x_n)

Demonstrated:
- Quadratic convergence (error e_{n+1} ≈ C·e_n²)
- Basin of attraction for multi-root functions
- Failure modes (zero derivatives, cycling)

For f(x) = x³ - 2x - 5, converges to root ≈ 2.0946 in ~5 iterations from x_0=3.

Code handles edge cases and tracks full iteration history.

TITLE: Implemented Newton-Raphson Root Finding with Visualizations - Quadratic Convergence is Satisfying

BODY:

Just built a complete implementation of the Newton-Raphson method and wanted to share some insights!

**What is Newton-Raphson?**

It's an iterative algorithm to find roots of equations (where f(x) = 0). The update formula is:

x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n) / f'(x_n)

Geometrically, you're finding where the tangent line at your current point crosses the x-axis.

**Why it's cool: Quadratic Convergence**

The number of correct digits roughly DOUBLES each iteration. Finding √2 starting from x=1:

| Iteration | Value | Error |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| 0 | 1.0 | 4e-1 |
| 1 | 1.5 | 9e-2 |
| 2 | 1.41666... | 2e-3 |
| 3 | 1.414215... | 2e-6 |
| 4 | 1.41421356... | 6e-12 |

Five iterations to machine precision!

**Interesting discoveries:**

1. The formula for √a simplifies to x_{n+1} = (x_n + a/x_n)/2 - this is the ancient Babylonian method!

2. Basin of attraction analysis shows which initial guesses lead to which roots. For f(x) = x³ - x (roots at -1, 0, 1), the boundaries between basins can be complex.

3. Failure modes: The method struggles when f'(x) ≈ 0 or when iterates cycle.

Ever wonder how calculators find square roots so fast?

The Newton-Raphson method is the answer! Starting with a guess, each step uses the formula:

new_guess = old_guess - f(old_guess)/f'(old_guess)

The magic? Each iteration DOUBLES your accuracy!

Finding √2 from scratch takes only 5 steps to get 12 correct digits.

Fun fact: This is actually an ancient Babylonian technique, rediscovered by Newton!

Implementing Numerical Methods: Newton-Raphson Root Finding

Just completed a comprehensive implementation of the Newton-Raphson algorithm, one of the most powerful techniques in numerical analysis.

Key Technical Highlights:

- Algorithm Implementation: Built a robust solver with convergence tracking, tolerance control, and edge case handling for zero derivatives

- Convergence Analysis: Demonstrated quadratic convergence where e_{n+1} ≈ C·e_n², meaning each iteration roughly doubles the number of correct significant figures

- Visualization Suite: Created four-panel analysis showing geometric interpretation, convergence rates, initial guess sensitivity, and basin of attraction mapping

- Practical Applications: Applied to compute √2 (Babylonian method), solve transcendental equations (x = cos(x)), and analyze polynomial roots

Skills Demonstrated:
- Numerical methods implementation
- Algorithm analysis and complexity
- Scientific visualization with matplotlib
- Edge case handling and robustness

The Newton-Raphson method remains foundational in optimization, machine learning, and scientific computing. Understanding its behavior and limitations is essential for any computational scientist.
