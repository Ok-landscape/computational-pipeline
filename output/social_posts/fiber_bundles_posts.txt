Ever wonder how a Mobius strip is different from a cylinder? It's all about FIBER BUNDLES - spaces twisted over base spaces. Transport a vector around the strip & it flips sign! Topology in action.

Fiber bundles: the mathematical framework unifying gauge theory, general relativity, and topology. A Mobius strip is a non-trivial bundle over S1 - one loop flips your fiber by 180 degrees. Computed visualizations of the Hopf fibration S1 -> S3 -> S2 in Python.

What do gauge theories, the Mobius strip, and magnetic monopoles have in common?

They're all described by FIBER BUNDLES - structures where you attach a "fiber" space to each point of a "base" space.

The wild part: some bundles are "twisted" (non-trivial). Walk around a Mobius strip and your fiber coordinate flips from +1 to -1.

The Hopf fibration (S1 -> S3 -> S2) is one of the most beautiful objects in math - every point on a 2-sphere corresponds to a circle in a 3-sphere.

New computational exploration: Fiber Bundles

A fiber bundle (E, B, pi, F) attaches fiber F to each point of base B via projection pi: E -> B. Key property: local triviality.

Computed examples:
- Trivial cylinder: S1 x I
- Mobius strip: non-trivial Z2 bundle, w1 != 0
- Tangent bundle TS1: parallelizable
- Hopf fibration: S1 -> S3 -> S2, first Chern class c1 = 1

Parallel transport test: vector returns negated after one Mobius loop - signature of non-trivial topology.

TITLE: [OC] Visualizing Fiber Bundles in Python - From Mobius Strips to the Hopf Fibration

BODY:

**What are fiber bundles?**

Imagine attaching a "fiber" (like a line segment or circle) to every point of a "base space" (like a circle or sphere). If you can do this in a nice, consistent way, you get a fiber bundle.

**The twist:**

Sometimes these bundles are "trivial" - globally just a product space like a cylinder (circle x line segment). But sometimes they're non-trivial, like the Mobius strip. Locally it looks like a product, but globally it has a twist!

**What I computed:**

1. **Trivial cylinder** - S1 x I, the boring one
2. **Mobius strip** - Non-trivial bundle. If you parallel transport a vector around the loop, it flips sign: s -> -s
3. **Tangent bundle of S1** - Tangent lines at each point of a circle
4. **Hopf fibration** - The beautiful S1 -> S3 -> S2. Every point on a 2-sphere corresponds to a circle in the 3-sphere

**Why does this matter?**

Fiber bundles are the language of modern physics:
- Electromagnetism = U(1) bundle
- Weak force = SU(2) bundle
- Strong force = SU(3) bundle
- Berry phase in quantum mechanics
- Magnetic monopole quantization

**The code:**

**TL;DR:** Fiber bundles = twisted product spaces. Mobius strip is non-trivial (flip after one loop). Hopf fibration is gorgeous. Physics uses these everywhere.

What if I told you a simple Mobius strip reveals deep truths about physics?

Fiber bundles are how mathematicians describe "twisted" spaces. A cylinder is a boring product: circle x line. But a Mobius strip? Walk around once and your fiber FLIPS.

This same math describes electromagnetism, the weak force, and why magnetic monopole charges must be quantized.

I visualized four examples in Python - from trivial cylinders to the mind-bending Hopf fibration.

Exploring Fiber Bundles: Where Abstract Mathematics Meets Physical Reality

Fiber bundles are fundamental structures that underpin modern theoretical physics - from gauge theories to general relativity.

In this computational notebook, I implemented visualizations of four canonical examples:

- Trivial cylinder bundle (S1 x I): The baseline "untwisted" case
- Mobius strip: A non-trivial line bundle where parallel transport negates fiber coordinates after one loop
- Tangent bundle TS1: Demonstrating how tangent spaces attach to manifolds
- Hopf fibration (S1 -> S3 -> S2): One of topology's most elegant structures, with applications to magnetic monopoles and Berry phases

Technical highlights:
- Parametric surface generation in R3
- Stereographic projection from S3 to R3
- Computational verification of non-triviality via parallel transport
- Characteristic class interpretation (Stiefel-Whitney w1, Chern class c1)

The same mathematical framework describes U(1) bundles (electromagnetism), SU(2) bundles (weak force), and SU(3) bundles (strong force).

FIBER BUNDLES - where geometry gets twisted

Four visualizations:
- Trivial cylinder (boring but important)
- Mobius strip (one loop = sign flip!)
- Tangent bundle of S1
- Hopf fibration (circles filling a 3-sphere)

Why care? This math runs physics:
- Electromagnetism (U(1) bundle)
- Weak force (SU(2) bundle)
- Strong force (SU(3) bundle)

The Mobius strip isn't just a paper trick - it's a non-trivial Z2 bundle with w1 != 0.

Math is beautiful when you can see it.
