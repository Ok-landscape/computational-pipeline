SVD decomposes ANY matrix into A = UΣVᵀ: rotation → scaling → rotation

This reveals hidden structure in data and enables powerful compression. Just 5 singular values can capture 90%+ of a matrix's information!

Singular Value Decomposition breaks any matrix into three parts: A = UΣVᵀ

Each singular value σᵢ quantifies how "important" that component is. The rapid decay means you often need just a few values to represent most of the data—the foundation of modern compression and ML.

Ever wonder how image compression actually works?

It's SVD—Singular Value Decomposition.

Any matrix A can be written as A = UΣVᵀ, where Σ contains singular values that decay rapidly. The magic: keeping only the largest values gives you an optimal low-rank approximation.

In my notebook, rank-5 approximation captured 90% of a matrix's energy. That's storing a fraction of the data while keeping most of the information.

This same math powers Netflix recommendations and noise reduction!

Implemented SVD analysis in Python using NumPy.

Key results:
• A = UΣVᵀ decomposition verified with reconstruction error ~10⁻¹⁴
• U and V orthogonality confirmed (error ~10⁻¹⁵)
• Singular values decay rapidly—rank 5 captures 90% energy for a noisy rank-5 matrix
• Demonstrated image compression: rank 20 uses only 41% storage

The Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem guarantees this is the BEST rank-k approximation in Frobenius norm. Foundational for PCA, recommender systems, and signal processing.

**Title:** I built an interactive notebook exploring Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) - here's what I learned

**Body:**

SVD is one of those topics that sounds intimidating but is actually beautifully intuitive once you see it in action.

**The core idea:** Any matrix A can be decomposed as A = UΣVᵀ, which breaks a linear transformation into three simple operations:
1. Rotate/reflect the input (Vᵀ)
2. Scale along coordinate axes (Σ)
3. Rotate/reflect to output (U)

**What surprised me:**

The singular values σᵢ decay incredibly fast. I created a noisy rank-5 matrix and found that just 5 singular values captured ~90% of the total "energy." This is why SVD is so powerful for compression—you can throw away most components and barely lose information.

**The Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem** proves this rank-k approximation is mathematically optimal. No other method can do better (in Frobenius norm).

**Practical demo:**

I compressed a synthetic image using SVD. Results:
- Rank 1: 4% storage (barely recognizable)
- Rank 5: 11% storage (main features visible)
- Rank 10: 21% storage (good quality)
- Rank 20: 41% storage (nearly indistinguishable)

The notebook includes visualizations of the singular value spectrum, cumulative energy curves, and approximation errors.

Happy to answer questions about the implementation!

Just finished a deep dive into SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)—the math behind image compression, Netflix recommendations, and noise reduction!

The core insight: any data matrix can be broken into components ranked by importance. Keep the top few, discard the rest, and you've compressed your data with minimal loss.

In my demo, just 5 components captured 90% of a matrix's information. Pretty remarkable!

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD): A Fundamental Tool in Data Science

I recently completed an implementation exploring SVD, one of the most powerful matrix factorization techniques in linear algebra.

**Technical Overview:**

SVD decomposes any m×n matrix A into A = UΣVᵀ, where U and V are orthogonal matrices and Σ contains singular values. This reveals the intrinsic geometric structure of linear transformations.

**Key Findings:**

• Reconstruction achieved machine precision (error ~10⁻¹⁴)
• Singular value decay enables efficient low-rank approximation
• Rank-5 approximation captured 90% of matrix energy
• Demonstrated practical image compression achieving 4× reduction with minimal quality loss

**Applications:**
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA)
- Recommender systems
- Signal denoising
- Natural language processing (LSA)

The Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem guarantees SVD provides the optimal low-rank approximation—a mathematically provable best solution.

The mathematics of compression ✨

This visualization shows how Singular Value Decomposition breaks down data into ranked components.

The singular values (blue bars) decay rapidly—meaning most information is captured in just the first few.

In this demo:
→ Rank 5 captures 90% of data
→ Rank 10 captures 99%

This is why your JPEGs are small but still look good. SVD finds the optimal way to keep what matters and discard the rest.

Math that actually works in the real world.
