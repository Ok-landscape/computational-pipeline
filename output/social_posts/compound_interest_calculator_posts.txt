The math behind wealth building: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

Built a Python calculator exploring compound interest, the Rule of 72, and why time beats timing.

Your money's best friend? Exponential growth.

Explored compound interest mathematics in Python today.

Key insight: The formula A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) shows why compounding frequency matters less than time in the market.

At 7% annual returns, monthly vs annual compounding adds only ~0.3% to your effective rate. Time is the real multiplier.

Just built a compound interest calculator in Python and the visualizations are eye-opening.

The gap between simple and compound interest over 30 years is massive. At 7%, $10K becomes:
- Simple: $31K
- Compound: $76K+

That purple shaded area in my plot? That's the "free money" from compounding.

Also validated the Rule of 72: divide 72 by your interest rate to estimate doubling time. At 8%, your money doubles in ~9 years. Math checks out!

New notebook: Compound Interest Calculator

Implemented the core formulas:
- Discrete: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
- Continuous: A = Pe^(rt)
- EAR: (1 + r/n)^n - 1

Interesting finding: As n → ∞, the difference between daily and continuous compounding becomes negligible. At 5% over 10 years, daily gives $16,486.65 vs continuous $16,487.21.

Also analyzed Rule of 72 accuracy - error stays under 2.4% for rates between 6-10%.

Code: numpy + matplotlib

**Title:** Built a Compound Interest Calculator in Python - Here's What I Learned About Exponential Growth

**Body:**

I created a Jupyter notebook to explore compound interest mathematics, and wanted to share some insights that surprised me.

**The Core Formula**

Future Value = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where P is principal, r is annual rate, n is compounding frequency, and t is time.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Compounding frequency has diminishing returns** - Going from annual to monthly compounding at 5% increases your effective rate from 5% to 5.116%. But monthly to daily? Only 5.116% to 5.127%. The jump to continuous compounding (using e^(rt)) adds just another 0.001%.

2. **The Rule of 72 actually works** - Divide 72 by your interest rate percentage to estimate doubling time. At 8%, money doubles in ~9 years. I tested this against the exact formula ln(2)/ln(1+r) and the error stays under 3% for reasonable rates.

3. **Time beats everything** - The visualization of simple vs compound interest over 30 years is striking. At 7%, $10K grows to ~$31K with simple interest but $76K+ with compound. That's the power of exponential growth.

**Technical Implementation:**

- Used numpy for calculations and matplotlib for visualizations
- Created functions for discrete compounding, continuous compounding, EAR, and present value
- Generated 4-panel figure comparing frequencies, rates, doubling times, and simple vs compound

**View the full notebook with interactive code:**

The visualizations really help internalize why Einstein (allegedly) called compound interest the "eighth wonder of the world."

Ever wonder why financial advisors always say "start investing early"?

I built a calculator to visualize compound interest, and the results are striking.

At 7% annual returns over 30 years:
- $10,000 with simple interest → $31,000
- $10,000 with compound interest → $76,000+

That extra $45K comes purely from your interest earning interest. Time is literally money.

Also learned the Rule of 72: divide 72 by your interest rate to see how long until your money doubles.

Compound Interest: A Mathematical Deep Dive

I recently built a Python-based compound interest calculator to explore the mathematics behind wealth accumulation. The project reinforced several key principles:

**Technical Implementation:**
- Developed functions for discrete compounding A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) and continuous compounding A = Pe^(rt)
- Calculated Effective Annual Rates to compare different compounding frequencies
- Validated the Rule of 72 approximation against exact doubling time calculations

**Key Quantitative Insights:**

1. Diminishing returns on compounding frequency: At 5% APR, moving from annual to daily compounding increases EAR by only 0.127 percentage points

2. Rule of 72 accuracy: Error remains below 2.4% for interest rates between 6-10%, making it a reliable mental math tool

3. Exponential vs linear: Over 30 years at 7%, compound interest yields 145% more than simple interest on the same principal

**Skills Demonstrated:** NumPy, Matplotlib, financial mathematics, data visualization

The full notebook with code and visualizations is available here:

The math of wealth building, visualized.

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

This formula shows how $10K becomes $76K+ over 30 years at 7% interest.

The purple shaded area in this plot? That's the difference between simple and compound interest - essentially "free money" from letting your returns generate their own returns.

Key insight: Time matters more than timing. Start early, stay consistent.

Built this calculator in Python to explore the Rule of 72 and why Einstein called compound interest the "eighth wonder of the world."
