Pure vs mixed quantum states: it's all in the density matrix ρ! Pure states have purity γ = Tr(ρ²) = 1, mixed states γ < 1. Visualized Rabi oscillations & Bloch sphere projections in Python.

Explored density matrix formalism in quantum mechanics today. The density operator ρ unifies pure and mixed state descriptions. Key insight: purity γ = Tr(ρ²) distinguishes pure states (γ=1) from mixed states (γ<1). Implemented Rabi oscillations and Bloch sphere visualizations in Python/NumPy.

Just built a complete density matrix toolkit in Python!

The density matrix ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ| is quantum mechanics' most versatile tool. Unlike state vectors, it handles both pure AND mixed states.

Cool findings:
- Pure states: purity = 1, entropy = 0
- Maximally mixed: purity = 1/d, entropy = ln(d)
- Single qubits map to Bloch sphere (pure = surface, mixed = inside)

Simulated Rabi oscillations showing how a qubit rotates under H = (ω/2)σₓ. The math is beautiful and the code is straightforward!

Implemented density matrix operations for quantum state analysis. The formalism handles mixed states via ρ = Σᵢ pᵢ|ψᵢ⟩⟨ψᵢ|.

Key computations:
- Purity: γ = Tr(ρ²), ranges from 1/d (maximally mixed) to 1 (pure)
- von Neumann entropy: S = -Tr(ρ ln ρ)
- Bloch representation: ρ = ½(I + r⃗·σ⃗)

Time evolution follows the von Neumann equation: dρ/dt = -i/ℏ[H,ρ]

Visualized Rabi oscillations and entropy vs mixing parameter. NumPy + SciPy make this elegant to implement.

**Title:** Built a density matrix toolkit in Python - visualizing pure vs mixed quantum states

**Body:**

Hey everyone! I created a Jupyter notebook exploring density matrices in quantum mechanics, and wanted to share what I learned.

**ELI5 Version:**
Imagine you have a coin. If you KNOW it's heads-up, that's a "pure state." But if someone flipped it and you don't know the result - you just know there's a 70% chance it's heads - that's a "mixed state." The density matrix is a mathematical object that can describe BOTH situations in one framework.

**What the notebook covers:**

1. **Pure state density matrices** - For a state |ψ⟩, we compute ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ|

2. **Mixed states** - Classical mixtures like ρ = p|0⟩⟨0| + (1-p)|1⟩⟨1|

3. **Purity and entropy** - Pure states have Tr(ρ²) = 1 and zero entropy. The maximally mixed state (p=0.5) has minimum purity = 0.5 and maximum entropy = ln(2)

4. **Bloch sphere** - Single qubit states map to a 3D ball. Pure states live on the surface (|r⃗| = 1), mixed states are inside (|r⃗| < 1)

5. **Time evolution** - Simulated Rabi oscillations under H = (ω/2)σₓ using the von Neumann equation

**Libraries used:** NumPy, SciPy (for matrix exponential), Matplotlib

The code is pretty clean - about 150 lines total. The trickiest part was getting the von Neumann entropy calculation right (need to filter out zero eigenvalues to avoid log(0)).

Ever wonder how physicists describe quantum uncertainty? Enter the density matrix!

Unlike regular quantum states, density matrices can represent situations where we have incomplete information - like knowing a photon is 70% likely horizontally polarized.

I built a Python notebook exploring this, including cool visualizations of:
- How "purity" measures quantum vs classical uncertainty
- The Bloch sphere (pure states on surface, mixed states inside)
- Rabi oscillations showing quantum state rotation

**Exploring Quantum State Representations Through Computational Methods**

Developed a comprehensive Jupyter notebook implementing density matrix formalism - a fundamental tool in quantum mechanics and quantum computing.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Constructed density matrices for pure states (ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ|) and statistical mixtures
- Computed key metrics: purity γ = Tr(ρ²) and von Neumann entropy S = -Tr(ρ ln ρ)
- Implemented Bloch sphere representation where single-qubit states map to r⃗ = (Tr(ρσₓ), Tr(ρσᵧ), Tr(ρσᵤ))
- Simulated unitary time evolution via the von Neumann equation using scipy.linalg.expm

**Key Insights:**
The notebook demonstrates how purity and entropy behave as mixing parameter varies - pure states have γ=1 and S=0, while the maximally mixed state has γ=1/d and S=ln(d).

**Tools:** Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib

This work reinforces skills in linear algebra, quantum information theory, and scientific visualization - directly applicable to quantum computing research and quantum machine learning applications.

The quantum world in one beautiful visualization

This plot shows the density matrix - quantum mechanics' most versatile tool for describing reality.

Top left: A qubit oscillating between |0⟩ and |1⟩ states (Rabi oscillations)

Top right: How "purity" drops as we lose information about a quantum state

Bottom left: Entropy peaks when uncertainty is maximum

Bottom right: The Bloch sphere - pure states on the edge, mixed states inside

Pure states: perfect knowledge
Mixed states: classical uncertainty
