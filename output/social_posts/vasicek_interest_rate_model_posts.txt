Interest rates don't wander randomly—they're pulled back to equilibrium like a spring!

The Vasicek model: dr = κ(θ - r)dt + σdW

Explored the Vasicek interest rate model—a foundational 1977 framework for modeling how rates evolve over time.

Key insight: rates exhibit mean reversion, gravitating toward long-term equilibrium θ.

Implemented exact simulation and Euler-Maruyama methods in Python with full visualization.

Ever wonder why interest rates don't just keep going up or down forever?

The Vasicek model explains this with mean reversion—rates get "pulled back" to an equilibrium level, like a spring.

The math: dr = κ(θ - r)dt + σdW

Where κ controls how fast rates snap back, θ is the target level, and σ is volatility.

I simulated 100 rate paths over 10 years. They all cluster around 5%—exactly as the model predicts.

Pretty cool to see theory match simulation!

Implemented the Vasicek short-rate model in Python.

The SDE: dr = κ(θ - r)dt + σdW

Key properties:
• Mean reversion with speed κ
• Stationary distribution: N(θ, σ²/2κ)
• Closed-form bond pricing: P(t,T) = A(t,T)·exp(-B(t,T)·r)

Used both exact simulation (exploiting the analytical solution) and Euler-Maruyama for comparison. Also derived yield curves showing convexity adjustment.

Limitation: allows negative rates (CIR fixes this).

**Title:** Implemented the Vasicek Interest Rate Model in Python—here's what I learned about mean reversion

**Body:**

I just built a simulation of the Vasicek model, one of the foundational models in quantitative finance for understanding how interest rates behave over time.

**ELI5 Version:**
Imagine interest rates as a ball attached to a spring. The spring always tries to pull the ball back to a resting position (the long-term average rate). The Vasicek model captures this "mean reversion" mathematically.

**The Math (simplified):**
The rate r changes according to: dr = κ(θ - r)dt + σdW

- κ (kappa) = how strong the spring is (speed of mean reversion)
- θ (theta) = where the spring wants to rest (long-term mean)
- σ (sigma) = random noise (volatility)
- dW = random Brownian motion

**What I implemented:**
1. Exact simulation using the closed-form solution
2. Euler-Maruyama discretization for comparison
3. Zero-coupon bond pricing using the analytical formula
4. Yield curve generation showing term structure

**Key findings:**
- With κ=0.5, θ=5%, σ=2%, starting at 3%, rates converge to ~5% over time
- The stationary distribution is Normal(θ, σ²/2κ)
- Bond prices have closed-form solutions, making this model analytically tractable

**Limitations:**
The normal distribution means negative rates are possible—the CIR model fixes this but loses some analytical tractability.

Happy to answer questions about the implementation or the math!

Just built a simulation showing how interest rates evolve over time using the Vasicek model from 1977.

The cool insight: rates don't wander randomly—they get "pulled back" to an equilibrium level, like a spring. Start at 3%, and over time they gravitate toward 5%.

The visualization shows 100 different possible rate paths, and they all cluster around that target. Math predicting reality!

**Quantitative Finance: Implementing the Vasicek Interest Rate Model**

I recently implemented a comprehensive Python simulation of the Vasicek model—a foundational framework in fixed income modeling introduced in 1977.

**Technical Implementation:**
• Exact path simulation using the closed-form solution
• Euler-Maruyama discretization scheme for comparison
• Zero-coupon bond pricing with analytical formulas
• Yield curve derivation showing convexity adjustment

**Key Mathematical Properties:**
The model describes rate dynamics as: dr = κ(θ - r)dt + σdW

This captures mean reversion—rates gravitate toward long-term equilibrium θ with speed κ, while σ introduces stochastic volatility.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Stochastic differential equations
- Monte Carlo simulation
- Financial derivatives pricing
- Scientific visualization with matplotlib

**Practical Application:**
The model provides closed-form bond prices P(t,T) = A(t,T)·exp(-B(t,T)·r), enabling efficient pricing of fixed income instruments.

Interest rates are like springs—always trying to snap back to equilibrium.

This visualization shows 100 simulated interest rate paths using the Vasicek model (1977).

Notice how they all cluster around 5%? That's mean reversion in action.

The model:
dr = κ(θ - r)dt + σdW

κ = how fast rates snap back
θ = target rate (5%)
σ = volatility

Starting at 3%, rates get pulled up.
Starting at 8%, they'd get pulled down.

One of the first models to capture this behavior mathematically.
