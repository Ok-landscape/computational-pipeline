The Secant Method: A derivative-free root-finding algorithm with superlinear convergence.

Instead of computing f'(x), it approximates derivatives using finite differences:
x_{n+1} = xₙ - f(xₙ) × (xₙ - xₙ₋₁)/(f(xₙ) - f(xₙ₋₁))

Convergence order: φ ≈ 1.618 (the golden ratio!)

Ever needed to find where a function equals zero but couldn't compute its derivative?

The Secant Method has you covered! It approximates derivatives using two points instead of calculus.

Key insight: Draw a line through two points on your curve, find where it crosses zero, repeat.

Convergence order? The golden ratio (φ ≈ 1.618)!

Tested it on finding √2 - converged in 6 iterations to 15 decimal places.

Perfect when derivatives are expensive or unavailable.

## 4. Mastodon (< 500 chars)

Implemented the Secant Method for root-finding in Python.

The iteration formula:
xₙ₊₁ = xₙ - f(xₙ) × (xₙ - xₙ₋₁)/(f(xₙ) - f(xₙ₋₁))

Convergence analysis shows superlinear convergence of order φ = (1 + √5)/2 ≈ 1.618

Compared to:
- Bisection: order 1 (linear)
- Newton: order 2 (quadratic)

Trade-off: Slower than Newton but requires no derivative computation.

Found √2 to machine precision in 6 iterations!

## 5. Reddit (Title + Body)

**Title:** I implemented the Secant Method in Python - a clever root-finding algorithm that doesn't need derivatives

**Body:**

Hey r/learnpython!

I just finished implementing the Secant Method for finding roots of equations, and wanted to share what I learned.

**What is it?**

The Secant Method finds where f(x) = 0 without needing the derivative f'(x). Instead of using calculus, it approximates the derivative using two points:

f'(xₙ) ≈ (f(xₙ) - f(xₙ₋₁))/(xₙ - xₙ₋₁)

**Why is it cool?**

1. **No derivatives needed** - Great when f'(x) is hard to compute
2. **Superlinear convergence** - The convergence order is the golden ratio φ ≈ 1.618
3. **Simple to implement** - Just a few lines of Python

**Example results:**

Finding √2 by solving x² - 2 = 0:
- Converged in 6 iterations
- Final accuracy: 10⁻¹⁵ (machine precision!)

**The trade-off:**

It's slower than Newton's method (order 2) but faster than bisection (order 1). Perfect middle ground when you can't compute derivatives.

Ever wondered how computers find square roots or solve complex equations?

I explored the Secant Method - a clever algorithm that finds where functions equal zero WITHOUT needing calculus!

The cool part: Its convergence rate is connected to the golden ratio (φ ≈ 1.618).

Test case: Found √2 to 15 decimal places in just 6 steps!

Exploring Numerical Methods: The Secant Method for Root Finding

In computational mathematics, root-finding algorithms are fundamental tools. I recently implemented and analyzed the Secant Method, which offers an elegant balance between simplicity and performance.

Key Technical Highlights:

• Derivative-free approach: Approximates f'(x) using finite differences, making it applicable when analytical derivatives are unavailable or computationally expensive

• Superlinear convergence: Order φ = (1+√5)/2 ≈ 1.618, outperforming bisection (linear) while requiring no derivative computation

• Practical trade-offs: Compared Newton's method (quadratic convergence) vs. Secant method - the latter requires only function evaluations, potentially reducing computational cost despite slower convergence

Implementation tested on:
- Algebraic equations (finding √2)
- Transcendental equations (x = cos(x))
- Polynomial roots

The analysis includes convergence visualization and error analysis confirming the theoretical golden ratio convergence order.

Finding roots the clever way

The Secant Method solves f(x) = 0 without derivatives!

How it works:
→ Take two guesses
→ Draw a line between them
→ Find where it crosses zero
→ Repeat until converged

Convergence order: φ ≈ 1.618
(Yes, the golden ratio!)
