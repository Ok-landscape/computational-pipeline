Swarm intelligence in action! Implemented Particle Swarm Optimization to minimize the Rastrigin function - a notoriously tricky multimodal benchmark.

v = w·v + c₁r₁(p - x) + c₂r₂(g - x)

40 particles, 100 iterations → convergence!

### Bluesky (300 chars)

Explored Particle Swarm Optimization today - a metaheuristic inspired by bird flocking behavior.

Key insight: balance individual memory (personal best p) with social learning (global best g) using:
v = w·v + c₁r₁(p - x) + c₂r₂(g - x)

Successfully minimized the Rastrigin function to near-zero.

Just built a Particle Swarm Optimizer from scratch!

PSO mimics how birds flock or fish school - each "particle" has:
- Position x in search space
- Velocity v
- Memory of its personal best p
- Knowledge of the swarm's global best g

The magic equation:
v(t+1) = w·v(t) + c₁r₁(p - x) + c₂r₂(g - x)

The inertia weight w decreases over time: explore early, exploit later.

Tested it on the Rastrigin function (80+ local minima!) and it found the global optimum at x* = 0.

No gradients needed - just swarm intelligence!

### Mastodon (500 chars)

Implemented Particle Swarm Optimization for continuous nonlinear optimization.

Velocity update equation:
v(t+1) = w·v(t) + c₁r₁(pᵢ - xᵢ) + c₂r₂(g - xᵢ)

Where:
- w = linearly decreasing inertia (0.9 → 0.4)
- c₁ = 2.0 (cognitive coefficient)
- c₂ = 2.0 (social coefficient)
- r₁, r₂ ~ U(0,1)

Tested on 2D Rastrigin: f(x) = 10n + Σ[xᵢ² - 10cos(2πxᵢ)]

40 particles converged to global minimum in ~50 iterations.

**Title:** I implemented Particle Swarm Optimization from scratch - here's how swarm intelligence finds global optima

**Body:**

Hey everyone!

I just completed an implementation of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and wanted to share what I learned.

**What is PSO?**

Imagine a flock of birds searching for food. Each bird:
- Remembers the best spot it personally found
- Communicates with others about the best spot anyone found
- Balances exploring new areas vs. returning to known good spots

PSO works the same way! Each "particle" is a candidate solution that moves through the search space.

**The Core Equation**

Each particle updates its velocity:

v(t+1) = w·v(t) + c₁r₁(personal_best - x) + c₂r₂(global_best - x)

Then updates position: x(t+1) = x(t) + v(t+1)

Where:
- w = inertia weight (decreases from 0.9 to 0.4)
- c₁ = cognitive coefficient (individual learning)
- c₂ = social coefficient (swarm learning)
- r₁, r₂ = random numbers between 0 and 1

**The Challenge: Rastrigin Function**

I tested it on the Rastrigin function - a brutal benchmark with 80+ local minima in just 2 dimensions:

f(x) = 10n + Σ[xᵢ² - 10·cos(2πxᵢ)]

The global minimum is at x* = (0, 0) where f(x*) = 0.

**Results**

With 40 particles and 100 iterations, PSO found the global minimum! The convergence plot shows rapid initial improvement followed by fine-tuning.

**Key Takeaways**

1. PSO doesn't need gradients - great for non-differentiable functions
2. The exploration→exploitation transition is elegant (decreasing inertia)
3. Parameter tuning matters: c₁ and c₂ balance individual vs. social learning

Ever wonder how nature solves optimization problems?

Particle Swarm Optimization mimics how birds flock - each "particle" searches for solutions while sharing information with others.

I implemented it in Python to solve the Rastrigin function, which has 80+ local minima. The swarm found the global optimum by balancing individual experience with group knowledge.

The visualization shows 40 particles converging from random positions to the solution. It's mesmerizing to watch!

**Implementing Nature-Inspired Optimization: Particle Swarm Optimization in Python**

Just completed a deep dive into Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a metaheuristic algorithm inspired by collective behavior in nature.

**Technical Implementation:**

Built a PSO optimizer with:
- Linearly decreasing inertia weight (0.9 → 0.4) for exploration-exploitation balance
- Velocity clamping and boundary reflection handling
- Configurable cognitive (c₁) and social (c₂) coefficients

**Benchmark Results:**

Tested on the Rastrigin function - a standard optimization benchmark with numerous local minima. The algorithm successfully converged to the global optimum using 40 particles over 100 iterations.

**Key Technical Skills Demonstrated:**
- NumPy-based vectorized computations for efficiency
- Object-oriented design with modular architecture
- Matplotlib visualization including 3D surfaces and convergence analysis

**When to Use PSO:**
- Non-differentiable objective functions
- Multimodal landscapes where gradient descent fails
- Black-box optimization problems

PSO offers a compelling balance of simplicity and effectiveness for continuous optimization challenges.

Swarm Intelligence
in Action

40 particles.
100 iterations.
1 global optimum.

This is Particle Swarm Optimization - inspired by how birds flock together.

Each particle remembers its personal best location and learns from the swarm's global best.

The Rastrigin function has 80+ local minima (those spiky peaks you see), but the swarm found the true minimum at the center.

Watch the particles converge from random chaos to collective intelligence.

No gradients needed - just nature's wisdom.
