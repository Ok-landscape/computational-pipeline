Why do atoms attract at long range but repel when close? The Lennard-Jones potential: V(r) = 4ε[(σ/r)¹² - (σ/r)⁶]. The r⁻¹² term = electron cloud repulsion, r⁻⁶ = van der Waals attraction. Equilibrium at r = 2^(1/6)σ.

Exploring the Lennard-Jones potential - the workhorse of molecular simulations. This elegant formula V(r) = 4ε[(σ/r)¹² - (σ/r)⁶] captures how atoms repel at close range (Pauli exclusion) and attract at distance (van der Waals forces). Visualized with Python/NumPy.

Ever wonder how computers simulate molecules interacting?

Meet the Lennard-Jones potential - a simple equation that models atomic interactions:

V(r) = 4ε[(σ/r)¹² - (σ/r)⁶]

Two key behaviors:
→ Atoms REPEL when too close (electron clouds overlap)
→ Atoms ATTRACT at medium distances (van der Waals forces)

The sweet spot? Equilibrium at r ≈ 1.122σ where forces balance perfectly.

Built visualizations showing how He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe each have unique interaction profiles!

Implemented the Lennard-Jones potential in Python today.

V(r) = 4ε[(σ/r)¹² - (σ/r)⁶]

Key insights:
• r⁻¹² term: Pauli repulsion (empirical but computationally convenient)
• r⁻⁶ term: London dispersion forces (QM-derived!)
• Minimum at r_m = 2^(1/6)σ
• Force: F(r) = (24ε/r)[2(σ/r)¹² - (σ/r)⁶]

Compared parameters for noble gases - Xe has well depth of 230K while He is only 10.2K. The heavier atoms interact much more strongly.

**Title:** Visualizing the Lennard-Jones Potential - The Foundation of Molecular Simulations

**Body:**

I created a Jupyter notebook exploring the Lennard-Jones potential, which is one of the most important equations in computational physics and chemistry.

**What is it?**

The LJ potential describes how two neutral atoms interact:

V(r) = 4ε[(σ/r)¹² - (σ/r)⁶]

Where:
- r = distance between atoms
- ε = depth of the potential well (interaction strength)
- σ = distance where potential equals zero

**ELI5 Version:**

Imagine two magnets, but weird. When far apart, they gently attract (van der Waals forces - think gecko feet sticking to walls). But push them too close and they STRONGLY repel (their electron clouds don't want to overlap - Pauli exclusion principle).

The "sweet spot" where forces balance is at r ≈ 1.122σ.

**Why r⁻¹² and r⁻⁶?**

- The r⁻⁶ term has real physics behind it (quantum mechanical perturbation theory for induced dipoles)
- The r⁻¹² term is chosen because 12 = 2×6, making computation faster!

**What I learned:**

1. How to decompose the potential into repulsive/attractive components
2. Noble gases have very different parameters - Xenon's well depth (230K) is 22× larger than Helium (10.2K)
3. The force is simply -dV/dr, and you can visualize where it's repulsive vs attractive

Code uses NumPy and Matplotlib. Happy to answer questions about the implementation!

How do atoms "know" to stick together... but not TOO close?

The Lennard-Jones potential answers this with one beautiful equation! It shows atoms gently attract from far away (van der Waals forces), but strongly repel when their electron clouds overlap.

This is the foundation of molecular dynamics simulations - from drug design to materials science.

I visualized it for noble gases (He to Xe) and you can see Xenon atoms interact 22× more strongly than Helium!

Exploring Computational Physics: The Lennard-Jones Potential

Just completed an analysis of the Lennard-Jones potential - a cornerstone model in molecular dynamics simulations.

The Model:
V(r) = 4ε[(σ/r)¹² - (σ/r)⁶]

This deceptively simple equation captures two fundamental atomic interactions:
• Short-range Pauli repulsion (r⁻¹² term)
• Long-range van der Waals attraction (r⁻⁶ term)

Technical Implementation:
- Built Python functions for potential and force calculations
- Visualized the decomposition into repulsive/attractive components
- Compared interaction parameters across noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe)
- Demonstrated how well depth ε scales from 10.2K (He) to 230K (Xe)

Key Insight: The r⁻¹² exponent is empirical (chosen as 2×6 for computational efficiency), while r⁻⁶ has rigorous quantum mechanical foundations in perturbation theory.

This model remains fundamental in:
- Drug discovery (protein-ligand interactions)
- Materials science (crystal structure prediction)
- Soft matter physics (colloidal systems)

The Lennard-Jones Potential

How atoms push and pull on each other, explained in one equation.

V(r) = 4ε[(σ/r)¹² - (σ/r)⁶]

→ Close together: REPEL (electron clouds clash)
→ Far apart: ATTRACT (van der Waals forces)
→ Sweet spot: equilibrium at r ≈ 1.122σ

This is how we simulate everything from noble gases to proteins in molecular dynamics.

The plot shows both the potential energy and force curves - notice how the force flips from positive (repulsive) to negative (attractive) right at the equilibrium point.
