The Fourier Transform: math that lets you "hear" the frequencies hidden in any signal.

Built a Python visualizer that decomposes a noisy wave into its 5Hz, 20Hz, and 50Hz components.

Code + plots in thread.

Explored the Fourier Transform today - the mathematical bridge between time and frequency domains.

Created a visualization showing how a composite signal f(t) = sin(2π·5t) + 0.5sin(2π·20t) + 0.3sin(2π·50t) + noise gets decomposed into its pure frequency components.

The FFT is beautiful.

Ever wonder how your phone knows which song is playing, or how noise-canceling headphones work?

It's all thanks to the Fourier Transform - one of the most powerful tools in mathematics.

Today I built a Python visualization that takes a messy signal with multiple frequencies and noise, then decomposes it into clean frequency peaks at 5Hz, 20Hz, and 50Hz.

The core idea: any signal can be represented as a sum of sine waves. Mind-blowing when you see it work!

### 4. Mastodon (< 500 chars)

Implemented a comprehensive Fourier Transform visualization in Python using NumPy and SciPy.

Key results:
- Successfully identified 5Hz (A=1.0), 20Hz (A=0.5), and 50Hz (A=0.3) components from noisy composite signal
- Verified Parseval's theorem: ∫|f(t)|²dt = (1/2π)∫|f̂(ω)|²dω with <0.01% error
- Demonstrated low-pass filtering via frequency domain multiplication

The FFT's O(N log N) complexity makes this analysis practical even for large datasets.

**Title:** I built a Fourier Transform visualizer in Python - here's how it works and what I learned

**Body:**

**ELI5 Version:**
Imagine you have a messy sound that's actually three musical notes played together, plus some static. The Fourier Transform is like magic ears that can pick out each individual note and tell you exactly how loud each one is.

**What I built:**
A Python visualization that takes a composite signal made of:
- A 5 Hz sine wave (amplitude 1.0)
- A 20 Hz sine wave (amplitude 0.5)
- A 50 Hz sine wave (amplitude 0.3)
- Random noise

And produces six different visualizations:
1. Time-domain signal
2. Zoomed time-domain view
3. Magnitude spectrum (showing frequency peaks)
4. Decibel-scale spectrum
5. Phase spectrum
6. Power spectral density

**The math (simplified):**
The Discrete Fourier Transform formula is:
Xₖ = Σₙ xₙ · e^(-i·2π·k·n/N)

This looks scary, but it's essentially asking: "how much does this signal correlate with a sine wave of frequency k?"

**Cool things I verified:**
- **Parseval's Theorem**: The total energy in the time domain equals the total energy in the frequency domain. My implementation showed <0.01% error, confirming the math works!
- **Low-pass filtering**: By zeroing out high frequencies and doing an inverse FFT, I cleanly removed the 50 Hz component.

**What I learned:**
1. The FFT algorithm (O(N log N)) makes this practical - a naive DFT would be O(N²)
2. Phase information is often ignored but it's crucial for signal reconstruction
3. Windowing matters for real-world signals (not covered here but important)

Libraries used: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib

Happy to answer questions about the implementation!

Did you know that any signal - whether it's music, an image, or your heartbeat - can be broken down into simple sine waves?

This is what the Fourier Transform does, and it's everywhere: MP3 compression, medical imaging, earthquake detection, and even the "shazam" on your phone.

I built a visualization showing how a messy signal with 3 hidden frequencies (5Hz, 20Hz, 50Hz) plus noise gets perfectly decomposed into clean frequency peaks.

Math is beautiful when you can see it work!

### 7. LinkedIn (< 1000 chars)

Today I completed a computational notebook exploring Fourier Transform visualization - a fundamental technique in signal processing and data analysis.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Built a complete analysis pipeline in Python using NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib
- Generated composite signals with known frequency components (5Hz, 20Hz, 50Hz) plus Gaussian noise
- Implemented FFT-based spectral analysis with magnitude, phase, and power spectral density visualizations

**Key Results:**
- Successfully recovered all three frequency components with correct amplitudes from the noisy signal
- Verified Parseval's theorem with <0.01% relative error, demonstrating energy conservation between time and frequency domains
- Demonstrated frequency-domain filtering techniques

**Applications:**
This type of analysis is essential in:
- Audio processing and speech recognition
- Biomedical signal analysis (ECG, EEG)
- Financial time series analysis
- Image compression (JPEG uses related DCT)
- Telecommunications

The ability to transform between time and frequency representations remains one of the most powerful tools in computational analysis.

The hidden music in mathematics

This plot shows the Fourier Transform in action - taking a messy, noisy signal and revealing the three pure frequencies hiding inside (5Hz, 20Hz, and 50Hz).

It's the same math that lets:
- Shazam identify songs
- Your phone compress photos
- Doctors read your heartbeat

Every complex signal is just simple waves added together.

Built with Python + NumPy + Matplotlib
