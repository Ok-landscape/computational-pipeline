Numerical solution of the Laplace equation in electrostatics using SOR method.

Simulated a parallel plate capacitor: V=100V on left, V=0V on right.

Key insight: ∇²V = 0 means potential at any point equals the average of its neighbors. Elegant physics!

Just built a numerical solver for the Laplace equation in electrostatics!

The equation ∇²V = 0 governs electric potential in charge-free regions. Used Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) to solve it efficiently.

Cool result: the optimal relaxation parameter w = 2/(1 + pi/N) makes convergence way faster than standard methods.

Visualized the potential surface, equipotential lines, and electric field streamlines. Field lines always cross equipotentials at right angles - that's fundamental physics in action!

Implemented a numerical Laplace equation solver for electrostatics using SOR (Successive Over-Relaxation).

Problem: nabla squared V = 0 with Dirichlet BCs (V=100V left, V=0V right)

The discrete form: V_ij = 1/4 (V_i+1,j + V_i-1,j + V_i,j+1 + V_i,j-1)

SOR accelerates convergence with w = 2/(1 + pi/N).

Computed E = -nabla V to get field lines. Beautiful perpendicularity between streamlines and equipotentials!

100x60 grid converged quickly to 10^-6 tolerance.

**Title:** Solved the Laplace Equation for Electrostatics using Python - Visualizing Electric Fields

**Body:**

I built a numerical solver for the Laplace equation (nabla squared V = 0) to model electrostatic potential in charge-free regions.

**What's the Laplace equation?**

In electrostatics, when there are no free charges, Gauss's law (nabla dot E = 0) combined with E = -nabla V gives us nabla squared V = 0. It's one of the most important PDEs in physics!

**The problem:**

A parallel plate capacitor setup - left plate at 100V, right plate grounded (0V), with open top/bottom boundaries.

**The method:**

Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) - an iterative technique where each grid point gets updated to a weighted average of its neighbors. The key insight is that solving nabla squared V = 0 discretely means:

V_ij = 1/4 (V_i+1,j + V_i-1,j + V_i,j+1 + V_i,j-1)

SOR speeds this up with a relaxation parameter w = 2/(1 + pi/N).

**Results:**

- 3D surface plot of potential
- Equipotential contours
- Electric field magnitude heatmap
- Field line streamlines (always perpendicular to equipotentials!)

The analytical solution for infinite plates is V(x) = V0 (1 - x/L). My numerical solution matches almost perfectly!

**Tools:** NumPy, Matplotlib

Ever wondered how electric fields work in a capacitor?

I used Python to solve the Laplace equation (nabla squared V = 0) - the fundamental equation governing electric potential when there are no charges around.

The coolest part: the solution reveals that electric field lines always cross equipotential surfaces at perfect right angles. Physics is beautiful!

Check out the visualizations showing potential surfaces, field lines, and equipotentials.

**Numerical Solution of the Laplace Equation in Electrostatics**

Just completed a computational physics project solving nabla squared V = 0 using Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) - a classic technique in scientific computing.

**Technical Approach:**
- Discretized the 2D Laplace equation using finite differences
- Implemented SOR with optimal relaxation parameter w = 2/(1 + pi/N)
- Applied Dirichlet boundary conditions for a parallel plate capacitor configuration
- Computed electric field vectors via E = -nabla V using NumPy's gradient function

**Key Results:**
- Achieved convergence to 10^-6 tolerance on a 100x60 grid
- Generated 3D potential surfaces, equipotential contours, field magnitude maps, and streamline visualizations
- Validated against analytical solution V(x) = V0 (1 - x/L) with minimal numerical error

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Numerical methods for PDEs
- Scientific Python (NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Physics simulation and visualization
- Computational electromagnetics

This methodology extends to complex geometries, 3D problems, and Poisson's equation for charge distributions.

Electric fields, visualized

Solved the Laplace equation numerically to model a parallel plate capacitor.

What you're seeing:
- 3D surface of electric potential
- Equipotential lines (constant voltage)
- Electric field streamlines
- Field magnitude heatmap

The math behind it: nabla squared V = 0

Every interior point equals the average of its neighbors. Simple rule, beautiful physics.
