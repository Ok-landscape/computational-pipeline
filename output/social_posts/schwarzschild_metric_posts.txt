Black holes curve spacetime so intensely that time itself slows down. At r = 1.5rₛ, your clock runs at just 58% speed vs. infinity.

Visualized the math in Python with embedding diagrams & orbital potentials.

The Schwarzschild metric describes spacetime around a non-rotating black hole. Key insight: at the ISCO (6rₛ), infalling matter releases 5.7% of its rest mass as energy—this powers quasars and X-ray binaries.

Created Python visualizations of metric components and effective potentials.

Einstein's equations have an exact solution for black holes: the Schwarzschild metric.

The math reveals mind-bending physics:
• Time dilation: clocks slow near massive objects
• Event horizon at r = rₛ where nothing escapes
• ISCO at 6rₛ: the closest stable orbit
• Photon sphere at 3rₛ: light orbits the black hole

I visualized these with Python—the embedding diagram (Flamm's paraboloid) shows how space itself curves into a funnel shape near the singularity.

GPS satellites actually correct for this time dilation daily!

Built a Python notebook exploring the Schwarzschild metric—the exact solution for spacetime around spherically symmetric masses.

Visualized:
• Metric components gₜₜ and gᵣᵣ diverging at the event horizon
• Time dilation factor √(1 - rₛ/r)
• Flamm's paraboloid embedding diagram
• Effective potential Veff showing ISCO at 6rₛ and photon sphere at 3rₛ

The Schwarzschild radius: rₛ = 2GM/c²

Matter at ISCO releases 5.7% of mc² as energy—powering the most energetic objects in the universe.

**Title:** Visualizing the Schwarzschild Metric: Black Hole Spacetime in Python

**Body:**

I created a Jupyter notebook exploring the Schwarzschild metric—Einstein's exact solution for spacetime around a non-rotating black hole.

**What is it?**

The metric describes how distances and time intervals are measured near a massive object. The line element is:

ds² = -(1 - rₛ/r)c²dt² + (1 - rₛ/r)⁻¹dr² + r²dΩ²

where rₛ = 2GM/c² is the Schwarzschild radius.

**Key visualizations:**

1. **Metric components** - Shows how gₜₜ → 0 and gᵣᵣ → ∞ at the event horizon
2. **Time dilation** - At r = 1.5rₛ, clocks run at 58% speed compared to infinity
3. **Flamm's paraboloid** - An embedding diagram showing spatial curvature as a funnel
4. **Effective potential** - Reveals the ISCO at 6rₛ and photon sphere at 3rₛ

**Why it matters:**

• GPS satellites correct for gravitational time dilation daily
• Matter falling to the ISCO releases 5.7% of its rest mass as energy (powers quasars!)
• The photon sphere explains gravitational lensing around black holes

**View the interactive notebook:** https://cocalc.com/github/Ok-landscape/computational-pipeline/blob/main/notebooks/published/schwarzschild_metric.ipynb

All code uses numpy and matplotlib—fully self-contained for anyone to run and modify.

Ever wondered what happens to space and time near a black hole?

I built a Python notebook exploring the Schwarzschild metric—the mathematical description of black hole spacetime.

Mind-blowing finding: at just 1.5× the event horizon radius, your clock would run at only 58% the speed of a clock far away! This "gravitational time dilation" is real—GPS satellites correct for it daily.

The notebook includes visualizations of how space curves into a funnel shape near the singularity.

**Computational General Relativity: Visualizing Black Hole Spacetime**

I developed a Jupyter notebook implementing numerical analysis of the Schwarzschild metric—Einstein's exact solution for spacetime geometry around non-rotating black holes.

**Technical Implementation:**

Using NumPy and Matplotlib, I visualized four key aspects:
• Metric tensor components showing divergence at the event horizon
• Gravitational time dilation factor √(1 - rₛ/r)
• Flamm's paraboloid embedding diagram via surface-of-revolution computation
• Effective potential for geodesic motion, identifying the ISCO and photon sphere

**Key Results:**

The analysis demonstrates that matter at the innermost stable circular orbit (6rₛ) releases 5.7% of its rest mass as energy—explaining the extreme luminosity of quasars and active galactic nuclei.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Scientific computing with Python
- 3D visualization and surface plotting
- Mathematical physics implementation
- Technical documentation

Black holes bend spacetime itself

This visualization shows Flamm's paraboloid—how space curves around a black hole like a funnel

The math behind it: the Schwarzschild metric describes exactly how clocks slow down and distances stretch near massive objects

At 1.5× the event horizon:
→ Time runs at 58% speed

At the photon sphere (3rₛ):
→ Light orbits the black hole

At the ISCO (6rₛ):
→ Last stable orbit before the plunge

All computed in Python with NumPy

This is real physics—GPS satellites correct for time dilation every day
