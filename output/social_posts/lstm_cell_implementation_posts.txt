Implemented a Long Short-Term Memory cell from first principles. LSTMs use three gates (forget, input, output) to control information flow through cell state and hidden state. Visualized gate activations on sinusoidal inputs - fascinating to see how the network learns to modulate memory over time.

Ever wonder how neural networks remember long sequences? I just built an LSTM cell from scratch!

The magic is in 3 gates:
- Forget gate: decides what to discard
- Input gate: controls new information
- Output gate: filters the result

The cell state acts like a conveyor belt, carrying information across time steps while gates add or remove info.

With just 384 parameters, it learns to process sine/cosine waves and captures temporal patterns beautifully. The visualization of gate activations is mesmerizing!

New notebook: LSTM Cell Implementation from Scratch

Built a complete Long Short-Term Memory cell with NumPy, implementing the core equations:

fₜ = σ(Wf·[hₜ₋₁, xₜ] + bf)
iₜ = σ(Wi·[hₜ₋₁, xₜ] + bi)
cₜ = fₜ⊙cₜ₋₁ + iₜ⊙tanh(Wc·[hₜ₋₁, xₜ] + bc)
hₜ = oₜ⊙tanh(cₜ)

Key insight: forget gate biases initialized to 1 for better gradient flow. Includes Xavier initialization and full sequence processing with gate activation visualizations.

**Title:** Built an LSTM Cell from Scratch - Here's How the Math Works

**Body:**

I implemented a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cell using only NumPy to understand how these networks actually work under the hood. Here's what I learned:

**ELI5 Version:**
Imagine you're reading a book and need to remember important plot points while forgetting irrelevant details. LSTMs do exactly this with three "gates":

1. **Forget Gate** - Like deciding "I don't need to remember what the character ate for breakfast"
2. **Input Gate** - "This new information about the villain is important, let me store it"
3. **Output Gate** - "When asked about the story, here's what I'll share"

**The Key Equations (in Unicode):**

- Forget: fₜ = σ(Wf·[hₜ₋₁, xₜ] + bf)
- Input: iₜ = σ(Wi·[hₜ₋₁, xₜ] + bi)
- Cell update: cₜ = fₜ⊙cₜ₋₁ + iₜ⊙c̃ₜ
- Output: hₜ = oₜ⊙tanh(cₜ)

Where σ is sigmoid, ⊙ is element-wise multiplication.

**Cool Findings:**

- With input dim=3 and hidden dim=8, we get 4×8×(8+3+1) = 384 parameters
- Initializing forget gate bias to 1 (not 0) helps gradient flow
- Cell states can grow unbounded; hidden states are bounded by tanh
- Gate activations show beautiful patterns when processing sinusoidal inputs

The visualization shows how different hidden units specialize in tracking different aspects of the input signal.

Just built a neural network memory cell from scratch!

LSTMs are the backbone of many AI systems that process sequences - think speech recognition, language translation, and time series prediction.

The secret? Three "gates" that control what to remember and what to forget. Like how we remember important plot points while reading but forget what we had for lunch.

Implemented everything in Python with just NumPy - no deep learning frameworks needed!

**Implementing LSTM Networks from First Principles**

I recently completed a from-scratch implementation of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cell, the foundational architecture behind many sequence modeling applications in NLP, speech recognition, and time series forecasting.

**Technical Highlights:**

• Implemented all four LSTM equations using NumPy with Xavier/Glorot initialization
• Created complete forward pass for both single timesteps and full sequences
• Visualized gate activations and state evolution across time

**Key Engineering Decisions:**

• Forget gate bias initialized to 1.0 (following Jozefowicz et al., 2015) for improved gradient flow
• Input clipping in sigmoid to prevent numerical overflow
• Separate storage of gate activations for interpretability analysis

**Methodology:**

The implementation processes synthetic sinusoidal signals (sin, cos, sin(2t)) through an 8-dimensional hidden state, demonstrating how different hidden units learn to track various input features. Parameter count: 384 for d=3, n=8.

This exercise reinforced the importance of understanding foundational architectures before using high-level frameworks.

LSTM Cell from Scratch ✨

Built this visualization of how neural networks remember!

LSTMs use 3 gates to control memory:
→ Forget gate: what to discard
→ Input gate: what to store
→ Output gate: what to share

The heatmaps show gate activations processing sine waves through time. Each row is a hidden unit learning different patterns.

Cool fact: With just 384 parameters, it learns temporal dependencies that regular networks can't capture.

Swipe to see the gate dynamics!
