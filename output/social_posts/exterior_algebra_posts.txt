The wedge product u ∧ v captures oriented area, while u ∧ v ∧ w gives volume. Built a Python implementation proving anticommutativity: u ∧ v = -(v ∧ u). 140+ years after Grassmann, his algebra is still essential.

Explored exterior algebra computationally: the wedge product ∧ generalizes the cross product to any dimension. Key insight: dim(Λᵏ(Rⁿ)) = C(n,k), giving a total dimension of 2ⁿ. Bivectors represent oriented areas, trivectors represent volumes. Implementation in Python.

Just implemented exterior algebra from scratch in Python!

What is it? A way to extend vectors into higher-dimensional objects called multivectors.

The wedge product (∧) has two beautiful properties:
- Anticommutativity: u ∧ v = -(v ∧ u)
- v ∧ v = 0 (wedging a vector with itself gives zero)

The coolest part? The coefficient of u ∧ v ∧ w equals the determinant - so exterior algebra unifies geometry and linear algebra!

Implemented exterior algebra (Grassmann algebra) in Python.

Key results:
- Wedge product ∧ is anticommutative: u ∧ v = -(v ∧ u)
- Bivector ||u ∧ v|| = ||u|| ||v|| sin(θ) (oriented parallelogram area)
- Trivector coefficient = determinant (parallelepiped volume)
- dim(Λᵏ(Rⁿ)) = C(n,k), total dim = 2ⁿ

Also showed: cross product = Hodge star of wedge product (u × v = ★(u ∧ v))

Foundation for differential forms, GR, and gauge theory.

Title: I built an exterior algebra implementation in Python - here's what I learned about wedge products, determinants, and geometric intuition

Body:

**TL;DR:** Exterior algebra is a beautiful framework that unifies vectors, areas, volumes, and determinants. I implemented it in Python and learned a lot about the connections between geometry and linear algebra.

**What is Exterior Algebra?**

Invented by Hermann Grassmann in 1844, exterior algebra extends vectors to include higher-dimensional objects called k-vectors:
- 0-vectors: scalars
- 1-vectors: ordinary vectors (directed line segments)
- 2-vectors (bivectors): oriented plane segments representing area
- 3-vectors (trivectors): oriented volumes

**The Wedge Product**

The key operation is the wedge product (∧), which satisfies:
- Anticommutativity: u ∧ v = -(v ∧ u)
- Alternating property: v ∧ v = 0

**Cool Results from My Implementation**

1. The norm of a bivector ||u ∧ v|| equals the parallelogram area spanned by u and v
2. For three vectors, the coefficient of u ∧ v ∧ w equals the determinant - so the wedge product computes volumes!
3. The dimension of k-vectors in Rⁿ is C(n,k), and the total exterior algebra dimension is 2ⁿ
4. Linear independence test: vectors are independent iff their wedge product is non-zero
5. The cross product is just the Hodge dual of the wedge product: u × v = ★(u ∧ v)

**Why It Matters**

Exterior algebra is the foundation for:
- Differential forms (integration on manifolds)
- General relativity
- Quantum mechanics and gauge theories
- Computer graphics and robotics

Ever wondered how mathematicians think about area and volume in higher dimensions?

I just explored exterior algebra - a 180-year-old mathematical framework that's still essential today. The key idea: the "wedge product" u ∧ v represents an oriented parallelogram, and u ∧ v ∧ w represents an oriented box.

The beautiful part? When you compute u ∧ v ∧ w, the result equals the determinant - connecting geometry to linear algebra!

Computational Mathematics: Implementing Exterior Algebra from Scratch

I recently built a Python implementation of exterior algebra (Grassmann algebra), a fundamental algebraic structure with applications across mathematics, physics, and engineering.

Key Technical Highlights:

- Implemented the wedge product with proper anticommutativity handling
- Developed k-vector representation using sparse dictionaries for efficiency
- Demonstrated that ||u ∧ v|| = ||u|| ||v|| sin(θ), confirming the geometric interpretation
- Verified the connection to determinants: u ∧ v ∧ w = det([u;v;w]) * (e₁ ∧ e₂ ∧ e₃)
- Implemented the Hodge star operator to derive the cross product

Applications demonstrated:
- Linear independence testing via wedge products
- Volume computation for parallelepipeds
- Dimension analysis: dim(Λᵏ(Rⁿ)) = C(n,k)

This work reinforces skills in numerical computing, mathematical abstraction, and algorithm design - all essential for roles in scientific computing, ML, and quantitative fields.

Exterior Algebra: Where Geometry Meets Linear Algebra

This visualization shows:
- Bivectors as oriented parallelograms (purple)
- Trivectors as oriented boxes (cyan)
- The dimension formula dim(Λᵏ(Rⁿ)) = C(n,k)
- Anticommutativity: u ∧ v = -(v ∧ u)

The wedge product ∧ generalizes the cross product to any dimension.

Fun fact: The coefficient of u ∧ v ∧ w equals the determinant!
