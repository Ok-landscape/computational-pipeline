### Twitter/X (< 280 chars)
K-Means clustering: the algorithm that finds patterns you didn't know existed.

Objective: minimize J = ∑(k=1 to K) ∑||xᵢ - μₖ||²

Built it from scratch in Python. Watch those centroids converge!

### Bluesky (< 300 chars)
Implemented K-Means clustering from scratch in Python.

The algorithm minimizes within-cluster variance by iteratively:
1. Assigning points to nearest centroid
2. Updating centroids as cluster means

Convergence guaranteed since J ≥ 0 and decreases each step. Silhouette score: 0.58

Ever wonder how Spotify groups similar songs or how customer segmentation works?

K-Means clustering is the answer!

The math is elegant: given n points in d-dimensional space, partition them into K clusters by minimizing the within-cluster sum of squares.

J = ∑||xᵢ - μₖ||²

I implemented it from scratch using K-Means++ initialization. The algorithm converged in just a few iterations, finding all 4 clusters perfectly.

Best part? The centroids were within 0.1 units of the true centers!

K-Means Clustering: Theory & Implementation

Built Lloyd's algorithm from scratch with K-Means++ initialization.

The objective function:
J = ∑(k=1 to K) ∑(xᵢ ∈ Cₖ) ||xᵢ - μₖ||²

Key insights:
- Convergence guaranteed (J bounded below, monotonically decreasing)
- Only reaches local minimum, not global
- Silhouette score achieved: 0.58

Also implemented the elbow method for optimal K selection. The "elbow" at K=4 matched our synthetic data perfectly.

**Title:** I implemented K-Means clustering from scratch - here's what I learned about how it actually works

**Body:**

Hey everyone! I just finished implementing K-Means clustering from scratch in Python (no sklearn), and wanted to share the key insights.

**What is K-Means?**

It's an unsupervised algorithm that partitions data into K clusters by minimizing the "within-cluster sum of squares" (WCSS):

J = ∑ ||xᵢ - μₖ||²

Basically, it tries to make each cluster as tight as possible around its center (centroid).

**How it works (Lloyd's Algorithm):**

1. Initialize K centroids (I used K-Means++ for better starting points)
2. Assign each point to its nearest centroid
3. Update each centroid as the mean of its assigned points
4. Repeat until convergence

**What I learned:**

- **Convergence is guaranteed** because J is bounded below by 0 and each step can only decrease it
- **But it's only a local minimum** - different initializations give different results
- **K-Means++ matters** - random initialization can lead to poor clustering
- **The elbow method works** - plotting inertia vs K clearly showed K=4 was optimal for my data

**Results:**

- Tested on synthetic Gaussian clusters (4 groups)
- Converged in ~10 iterations
- Silhouette score: 0.58 (solid separation)
- Learned centroids were within 0.1 units of true centers

**Limitations to keep in mind:**

- Assumes spherical clusters
- Sensitive to outliers
- You need to specify K beforehand

Happy to answer questions about the implementation!

### Facebook (< 500 chars)

Ever wondered how Netflix knows what shows to recommend or how retailers group customers?

The answer is K-Means clustering - one of the most elegant algorithms in machine learning!

I just built it from scratch in Python. The algorithm finds natural groups in data by repeatedly assigning points to their nearest center, then updating those centers.

The cool part? It's mathematically guaranteed to converge, and my implementation found all 4 hidden clusters perfectly!

**K-Means Clustering: From Theory to Implementation**

I recently completed an implementation of K-Means clustering from scratch in Python, deepening my understanding of this foundational unsupervised learning algorithm.

**Technical Approach:**

The algorithm minimizes the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS): J = ∑||xᵢ - μₖ||²

Key implementation decisions:
- Used K-Means++ initialization for improved centroid starting positions
- Implemented convergence checking with configurable tolerance
- Added tracking for centroid movement visualization

**Results:**

- Successfully clustered synthetic Gaussian data into 4 groups
- Achieved silhouette score of 0.58
- Learned centroids matched true centers within 0.1 units
- Clear "elbow" at K=4 validated cluster selection

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- Algorithm implementation without ML libraries
- Mathematical understanding of optimization objectives
- Data visualization (matplotlib)
- Performance metric evaluation

This exercise reinforced the importance of understanding algorithms at a fundamental level rather than treating them as black boxes.

### Instagram (< 500 chars)

Finding hidden patterns in data, one iteration at a time.

K-Means clustering is beautifully simple:
→ Start with random centers
→ Assign points to nearest center
→ Update centers
→ Repeat until stable

Watch those centroids dance across the plot until they settle into place.

Result: 4 perfect clusters found, silhouette score 0.58

Sometimes the most powerful algorithms are also the most elegant.
