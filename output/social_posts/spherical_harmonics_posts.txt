Exploring spherical harmonics—the complete orthonormal basis for functions on a sphere.

These elegant functions Yₗᵐ(θ,φ) solve Laplace's equation and appear everywhere: quantum mechanics, geophysics, computer graphics.

Verified orthonormality: ∫Y₁*Y₂ dΩ = δₗₗ'δₘₘ'

Just built a visualization of spherical harmonics and I'm fascinated by how these shapes appear everywhere in physics!

Spherical harmonics Yₗᵐ are solutions to Laplace's equation ∇²f = 0 on a sphere. The degree l controls how many "lobes" you see, while m determines the rotational pattern.

They're orthonormal—integrating Yₗᵐ* × Yₗ'ᵐ' over the sphere gives 1 if they match, 0 otherwise.

Where do they show up? Electron orbitals, Earth's magnetic field, and even video game lighting!

Implemented spherical harmonics visualization and orthonormality verification in Python.

Spherical harmonics Yₗᵐ(θ,φ) form a complete orthonormal basis on S². Defined via associated Legendre polynomials:

Yₗᵐ = √[(2l+1)/4π × (l-m)!/(l+m)!] × Pₗᵐ(cosθ) × eⁱᵐᶠ

Numerical integration confirms:
∫∫ Yₗᵐ* Yₗ'ᵐ' sinθ dθ dφ = δₗₗ'δₘₘ'

Also demonstrated function expansion: cos(θ) + sin(θ)cos(φ) → coefficients in Y₁⁰ and Y₁±¹

**Title:** Visualizing Spherical Harmonics and Verifying Their Orthonormality with Python/SciPy

**Body:**

I created an interactive notebook exploring spherical harmonics—those beautiful mathematical functions that describe shapes on a sphere.

**What are spherical harmonics?**

Imagine you want to describe any pattern on the surface of a sphere (like temperature variations on Earth, or an electron's probability cloud). Spherical harmonics Yₗᵐ(θ,φ) are the "building blocks" that let you do this. Any function on a sphere can be written as a sum of these harmonics—similar to how Fourier series decompose periodic functions into sines and cosines.

**The math (simplified):**

They're solutions to Laplace's equation (∇²f = 0) in spherical coordinates. Each harmonic is labeled by:
- l (degree): controls complexity (more lobes as l increases)
- m (order): ranges from -l to +l, controls rotational structure

The key property is orthonormality: when you integrate one harmonic times the conjugate of another over the whole sphere, you get 1 if they're the same, 0 otherwise.

**What I built:**

1. Visualized 9 harmonics (l=0,1,2,3) as 3D surfaces where the radius represents |Yₗᵐ|
2. Numerically verified orthonormality using integration
3. Showed how to expand a test function f(θ,φ) = cos(θ) + sin(θ)cos(φ) into harmonic coefficients

**Why it matters:**

- Quantum mechanics: electron orbital shapes (s, p, d orbitals)
- Geophysics: modeling Earth's gravitational and magnetic fields
- Computer graphics: environment mapping and global illumination

Ever wonder how scientists describe patterns on a sphere—like Earth's gravity or an electron's shape?

Meet spherical harmonics! These mathematical functions Yₗᵐ are the "building blocks" for any pattern on a sphere.

I visualized 9 of these beautiful shapes using Python. The degree l controls complexity (more lobes = higher l), and they have a magical property: they're perfectly orthogonal to each other.

Spherical Harmonics: Bridging Pure Mathematics and Real-World Applications

Just completed a computational exploration of spherical harmonics—a cornerstone of applied mathematics with far-reaching implications.

**Technical Implementation:**

Using Python with NumPy and SciPy, I:
• Visualized spherical harmonics Yₗᵐ(θ,φ) for degrees l=0 through 3
• Numerically verified orthonormality through surface integration
• Demonstrated function expansion by computing harmonic coefficients

**Why This Matters:**

Spherical harmonics provide a complete orthonormal basis for functions on the sphere, enabling:

• Quantum Chemistry: Atomic orbital calculations (s, p, d, f orbitals)
• Geophysics: Gravitational and magnetic field modeling
• Computer Graphics: Real-time environment lighting in games and VFX
• Signal Processing: Spherical data compression and analysis

The mathematical elegance lies in their orthonormality—the inner product ∫Yₗᵐ*Yₗ'ᵐ' dΩ equals 1 for matching harmonics and 0 otherwise, enabling clean decomposition of complex spherical data.

Spherical harmonics ✨

These mathematical shapes describe patterns on spheres—from electron clouds to Earth's gravity field.

Each one is labeled Yₗᵐ where:
• l = degree (higher → more complex)
• m = order (controls rotation)

The beautiful part? They're orthonormal. Integrate one against another over a sphere and you get 0 unless they match perfectly.

Used Python + SciPy to visualize 9 harmonics and verify this property numerically.

Applications: quantum physics, geophysics, CGI lighting
