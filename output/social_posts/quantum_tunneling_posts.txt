Particles can pass through walls they shouldn't. That's quantum tunneling.

We simulated an electron tunneling through a 0.5nm barrier with 5eV height.

At E=2.5eV: T=0.0899
At E=4.0eV: T=0.4172

The math is wild: T ≈ e^(-2κa)

Quantum tunneling: where particles ignore classical physics and pass through energy barriers they "shouldn't" be able to cross.

Simulated electron transmission through a rectangular barrier using the Schrodinger equation.

Key insight: Transmission drops exponentially with barrier width (T ≈ e^(-2κa)).

Ever wonder how particles can pass through solid barriers? That's quantum tunneling!

In classical physics, a ball can't roll through a hill if it doesn't have enough energy. But quantum particles? They can "tunnel" through.

I built a Python simulation showing:
- Wave function decay inside the barrier
- Transmission coefficient calculations
- How doubling barrier width drops transmission by ~1000x

This is the physics behind scanning tunneling microscopes, nuclear fusion, and tunnel diodes.

Implemented quantum tunneling simulation in Python using the time-independent Schrodinger equation.

For a rectangular barrier (V₀=5eV, a=0.5nm):
- Solved for wave functions in all three regions
- Calculated transmission coefficient using exact formula
- T = 1/(1 + V₀²sinh²(κa)/(4E(V₀-E)))

Results for electron at E=3eV:
- 0.2nm width: T = 2.45×10⁻¹
- 0.5nm width: T = 1.49×10⁻¹
- 1.0nm width: T = 9.45×10⁻⁴
- 1.5nm width: T = 5.24×10⁻⁶

Exponential suppression in action.

**Title:** I simulated quantum tunneling in Python - here's how particles pass through "impossible" barriers

**Body:**

**What is quantum tunneling?**

In classical physics, if you roll a ball toward a hill and it doesn't have enough energy to get over, it bounces back. Simple.

In quantum mechanics, particles don't play by these rules. Due to their wave-like nature, they have a non-zero probability of appearing on the other side of energy barriers even when they "shouldn't" have enough energy. This is quantum tunneling.

**What I built:**

A Python simulation that:
1. Solves the Schrodinger equation for a particle hitting a rectangular potential barrier
2. Calculates the exact transmission coefficient
3. Visualizes the wave function showing exponential decay inside the barrier

**Key parameters:**
- Barrier height: V₀ = 5 eV
- Barrier width: a = 0.5 nm
- Particle: electron

**Results:**

At E = 2.5 eV (half the barrier height), transmission is about 9%. At E = 4.0 eV, it jumps to 42%.

The formula for tunneling probability:
T = 1/(1 + V₀²sinh²(κa)/(4E(V₀-E)))

Where κ = √(2m(V₀-E))/h-bar

**Why this matters:**

Quantum tunneling enables:
- Nuclear fusion in stars (protons tunnel through Coulomb barriers)
- Scanning tunneling microscopes (atomic-scale imaging)
- Tunnel diodes and flash memory
- Enzyme catalysis in biology

**What I learned:**

The exponential dependence on barrier width is striking. Doubling the width from 0.5nm to 1.0nm drops transmission from ~15% to ~0.09%. This sensitivity is what makes STM imaging possible.

Mind-bending physics: Quantum particles can pass through barriers they shouldn't be able to cross!

I simulated this with Python - an electron hitting an energy wall. Classically, it should bounce back. Quantum mechanically? It has a real chance of appearing on the other side.

This isn't science fiction. It's how scanning tunneling microscopes image individual atoms, and it's happening right now in the nuclear fusion powering our Sun.

**Computational Physics Project: Quantum Tunneling Simulation**

I developed a Python-based simulation of quantum mechanical tunneling through potential barriers, demonstrating the wave-like nature of matter at nanometer scales.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Solved the time-independent Schrodinger equation analytically
- Implemented exact transmission coefficient calculations using transfer matrix methods
- Visualized wave function probability densities across three spatial regions
- Analyzed exponential dependence of tunneling on barrier parameters

**Key Results:**
For an electron encountering a 5 eV barrier:
- Transmission varies from 90% (near barrier top) to 0.0005% (at 1.5nm width)
- Demonstrated the characteristic T ~ e^(-2κa) exponential suppression

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Quantum mechanics and mathematical physics
- Scientific Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)
- Numerical analysis and visualization
- Technical documentation

This phenomenon underpins technologies from scanning tunneling microscopy to quantum computing with Josephson junctions.

Quantum particles break the rules.

In classical physics, not enough energy = no passage.

In quantum mechanics? Particles can tunnel straight through barriers.

This simulation shows:
- An electron hitting a 5eV energy wall
- The wave function decaying exponentially inside
- Real probability of appearing on the other side

This is how we image individual atoms with scanning tunneling microscopes.

This is how the Sun produces energy through nuclear fusion.

Quantum mechanics is wild.
