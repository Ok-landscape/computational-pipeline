Implemented GMRES (Generalized Minimal Residual) from scratch.

This 1986 algorithm by Saad & Schultz solves Ax = b for non-symmetric systems by minimizing residuals over Krylov subspaces: K_k(A, r₀) = span{r₀, Ar₀, A²r₀, ...}

Eigenvalue distribution matters more than you'd think for convergence.

Ever wondered how computers solve massive systems of equations that aren't symmetric?

GMRES is the answer. It builds an orthonormal basis using the Arnoldi process, then finds the solution that minimizes ||r_k||₂ at each step.

The magic: Givens rotations turn the problem into a simple triangular solve.

I tested it on convection-diffusion problems - when convection strength increases, eigenvalues spread into the complex plane and convergence slows. Clustering eigenvalues away from zero is key!

New notebook: GMRES algorithm implementation from scratch.

Key insight: GMRES minimizes ||b - Ax||₂ over Krylov subspace K_k(A, r₀).

The algorithm:
1. Arnoldi iteration builds orthonormal basis V_k
2. Forms upper Hessenberg matrix: AV_k = V_{k+1}H̄_k
3. Givens rotations solve min ||βe₁ - H̄_k y||₂

Tested on 1D convection-diffusion: -εu'' + cu' = f

Convergence bound: ||r_k||/||r₀|| ≤ min over polynomials p(λ) where p(0)=1

**Title:** Implemented GMRES from scratch - here's what I learned about solving non-symmetric linear systems

**Body:**

I just finished implementing the GMRES (Generalized Minimal Residual) algorithm in Python, and wanted to share some insights.

**What is GMRES?**

When you have a system Ax = b where A isn't symmetric (so you can't use Conjugate Gradient), GMRES is your friend. It's an iterative method that finds the solution minimizing ||b - Ax||₂.

**The core idea (ELI5):**

Imagine you're searching for treasure in a field. Instead of searching everywhere, GMRES cleverly expands its search area step by step using something called a Krylov subspace: K_k = span{r₀, Ar₀, A²r₀, ...}

At each step, it guarantees finding the best possible approximation in its current search space.

**Key components I implemented:**

1. **Arnoldi iteration** - Builds an orthonormal basis using modified Gram-Schmidt
2. **Givens rotations** - Efficiently solves the least squares problem
3. **Convergence monitoring** - Residual decreases monotonically (guaranteed!)

**What I learned:**

- Eigenvalue distribution matters hugely. When I tested on convection-diffusion problems (-εu'' + cu' = f), increasing convection c spread eigenvalues into the complex plane and slowed convergence
- Eigenvalue clustering away from zero = faster convergence
- Memory grows as O(nk) for k iterations - that's why restarted GMRES exists

The math is beautiful: the convergence bound involves finding the optimal polynomial p(λ) with p(0)=1 that minimizes max|p(λ)| over all eigenvalues.

Just built a classic numerical algorithm from scratch: GMRES!

When engineers and scientists need to solve huge systems of equations (think millions of variables), they can't just hit "solve" - they need clever iterative methods.

GMRES finds approximate solutions that get better and better, minimizing the error at each step. The cool part? It handles "asymmetric" problems that simpler methods can't touch.

Tested it on fluid-flow-type equations and visualized how the solution converges.

Implemented the GMRES (Generalized Minimal Residual) algorithm from scratch to deepen my understanding of iterative methods for sparse linear systems.

**Technical highlights:**

GMRES solves Ax = b for non-symmetric matrices by minimizing ||b - Ax||₂ over Krylov subspaces. The implementation includes:

- Arnoldi iteration with modified Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization
- Givens rotations for efficient least squares solution
- Convergence analysis with eigenvalue visualization

**Key findings from numerical experiments:**

Tested on 1D convection-diffusion problems (-εu'' + cu' = f). Results show:
- Convergence rate strongly depends on eigenvalue distribution
- Increased convection coefficient spreads spectrum into complex plane
- Clustering eigenvalues away from zero accelerates convergence

**Skills demonstrated:** Python, NumPy, SciPy, numerical linear algebra, algorithm implementation, scientific visualization

This foundational algorithm (Saad & Schultz, 1986) remains essential in computational science, from CFD to machine learning preconditioners.

GMRES: Solving the Unsolvable

When matrices aren't symmetric, you need GMRES.

This algorithm iteratively finds solutions to Ax = b by:

→ Building orthonormal bases (Arnoldi)
→ Minimizing residual ||b - Ax||₂
→ Using Givens rotations for efficiency

The plot shows how eigenvalue distribution affects convergence - more spread in the complex plane means slower solving.

Built from scratch in Python.
Tested on convection-diffusion equations.
Verified against SciPy.
