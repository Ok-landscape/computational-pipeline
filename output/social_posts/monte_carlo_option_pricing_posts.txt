Ever wondered how Wall Street prices options? Monte Carlo simulation runs 100,000 random scenarios to find fair value. Our result matched Black-Scholes to 4 decimal places!

Monte Carlo option pricing: simulate stock paths using geometric Brownian motion, calculate expected payoffs, discount to present value. With 100k simulations, we matched Black-Scholes analytical solution with <0.5% error. Standard error decays as 1/√N.

How do quants price options when there's no closed-form solution?

Monte Carlo simulation! Here's how it works:

1. Model stock prices with geometric Brownian motion: S_T = S₀·exp[(r - σ²/2)T + σ√T·Z]
2. Simulate thousands of price paths
3. Calculate option payoffs for each path
4. Average and discount back to today

With 100,000 simulations, we priced a call option at $8.02 vs Black-Scholes $8.02. Antithetic variates reduced variance by ~50%!

Implemented Monte Carlo option pricing in Python. Key findings:

• Stock prices follow GBM: dS = rS·dt + σS·dW
• Call price: C = e^(-rT) · E[max(S_T - K, 0)]
• Standard error scales as O(1/√N)
• Antithetic variates (using both Z and -Z) reduced variance ~50%

For S₀=$100, K=$105, r=5%, σ=20%, T=1yr:
Monte Carlo: $8.0215 ± $0.0476
Black-Scholes: $8.0214

Put-call parity verified to 6 decimal places.

**Title:** Monte Carlo Simulation for Option Pricing - Python Implementation with Variance Reduction

**Body:**

I built a Monte Carlo option pricing model in Python and wanted to share what I learned!

**The Problem:** How do you price a financial option (the right to buy/sell a stock at a fixed price)?

**ELI5 Version:** Imagine you want to know the fair price of a lottery ticket. You could:
1. Simulate the lottery 100,000 times
2. Calculate your winnings each time
3. Average them all
4. That's roughly what the ticket is worth!

That's Monte Carlo simulation in a nutshell.

**The Math (simplified):**
- Stock prices follow random walks (geometric Brownian motion)
- S_T = S₀ · exp[(r - σ²/2)T + σ√T · Z], where Z ~ Normal(0,1)
- Option payoff = max(S_T - Strike, 0) for calls
- Price = discounted average of all simulated payoffs

**Results:**
- 100,000 simulations
- Monte Carlo price: $8.0215
- Black-Scholes (exact): $8.0214
- Error: 0.01%!

**Key Insight:** Standard error decreases as 1/√N, so you need 100× more simulations for 10× better precision. That's why variance reduction matters!

**Bonus - Antithetic Variates:**
Instead of just using random number Z, also use -Z. This creates negative correlation between paired estimates, reducing variance by ~50% for free!

How does Wall Street actually price options?

I built a Monte Carlo simulator that runs 100,000 random stock price scenarios and averages the results. The cool part: it matched the famous Black-Scholes formula to 4 decimal places!

Key finding: ~42% of simulated options expired worthless (stock never reached strike price). That's the risk you're paying for!

**Monte Carlo Methods in Quantitative Finance: A Python Implementation**

Just completed a comprehensive implementation of Monte Carlo option pricing, demonstrating core techniques used across quantitative finance and risk management.

**Technical Approach:**
• Modeled stock dynamics using geometric Brownian motion under risk-neutral measure
• Implemented efficient vectorized NumPy simulations (100,000 paths)
• Validated against Black-Scholes closed-form solution
• Applied variance reduction via antithetic variates

**Key Results:**
• Monte Carlo estimate: $8.0215 (±$0.0476 SE)
• Black-Scholes benchmark: $8.0214
• Relative error: <0.01%
• Variance reduction: ~50% improvement with antithetic variates

**Skills Demonstrated:**
• Stochastic calculus (Itô's lemma, risk-neutral pricing)
• Statistical estimation and confidence intervals
• Numerical methods and convergence analysis
• Python scientific computing (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)

This methodology extends to exotic derivatives where closed-form solutions don't exist—Asian options, barrier options, and path-dependent structures.

Monte Carlo Option Pricing

How Wall Street prices options when math alone won't cut it:

→ Simulate 100,000 random stock paths
→ Calculate what each option would pay
→ Average and discount to today
→ That's your fair price

Results: $8.0215 vs $8.0214 (Black-Scholes exact)
Error: 0.01%

The plot shows:
• Convergence as simulations increase
• Standard error decay (1/√N)
• Payoff distribution (42% expire worthless!)
• Price sensitivity to volatility
