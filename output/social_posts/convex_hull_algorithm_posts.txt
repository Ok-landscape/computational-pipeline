Explored the Graham Scan algorithm for computing convex hulls - the smallest convex boundary around a point set.

Key insight: use cross products to detect clockwise vs counter-clockwise turns.

Time complexity: O(n log n)

Verified against SciPy's implementation.

Ever wonder how computers find the outer boundary of a scattered set of points?

The convex hull is like stretching a rubber band around nails - it snaps to the outermost points.

I implemented the Graham Scan algorithm in Python:
• Find the lowest point as anchor
• Sort other points by polar angle θ = arctan(Δy/Δx)
• Use cross products to keep only "left turns"

Result: O(n log n) time complexity. From 50 random points → just 12 hull vertices!

Implemented Graham Scan for convex hull computation in Python.

Algorithm overview:
1. Select anchor point (min y-coordinate)
2. Sort points by polar angle: θ = arctan((yᵢ - y₀)/(xᵢ - x₀))
3. Iterate through sorted points, maintaining stack
4. Cross product determines turn direction:
   cross > 0 → CCW turn (keep)
   cross ≤ 0 → CW turn (pop)

Complexity: O(n log n)

Also computed hull area via Shoelace formula and verified against scipy.spatial.ConvexHull.

**Body:**

**What is a Convex Hull?**

Imagine you have a bunch of nails scattered on a board. If you stretch a rubber band around all of them and let it snap tight, the shape it forms is the convex hull - the smallest convex boundary that contains all points.

**The Graham Scan Algorithm**

I implemented this classic O(n log n) algorithm:

1. **Find the anchor**: Pick the point with the lowest y-coordinate
2. **Sort by angle**: Order all other points by their polar angle from the anchor
3. **Build the hull**: Go through each point and use the cross product to check if we're turning left (counter-clockwise) or right (clockwise). Only keep left turns!

**The Cross Product Trick**

For three points (p₁, p₂, p₃), calculate:

cross = (x₂ - x₁)(y₃ - y₂) - (y₂ - y₁)(x₃ - x₂)

- Positive → counter-clockwise (keep the point)
- Negative or zero → clockwise (remove it)

**Results**

From 50 random points, the algorithm found 12 hull vertices. I also calculated:
- Hull area using the Shoelace formula
- Perimeter
- Compactness ratio (4πA/P²)

Verified my implementation against SciPy's ConvexHull - same vertices!

**Why This Matters**

Convex hulls are used everywhere: collision detection in games, pattern recognition, GIS systems, and as preprocessing for other geometry algorithms.

Ever wondered how computers find the outer boundary of scattered points?

The convex hull is like a rubber band stretched around nails - it snaps to form the smallest shape containing all points.

I coded the Graham Scan algorithm in Python. The clever part: using cross products to detect turn directions. Positive = left turn (keep), negative = right turn (discard).

From 50 random points → only 12 form the boundary!

**Computational Geometry: Implementing the Graham Scan Algorithm**

Just completed an implementation of the Graham Scan convex hull algorithm - a fundamental technique in computational geometry with O(n log n) time complexity.

**Technical Approach:**

The algorithm elegantly combines sorting with stack-based processing:
• Identify anchor point (minimum y-coordinate)
• Sort remaining points by polar angle using arctan(Δy/Δx)
• Process sequentially, using cross products to determine turn direction
• Maintain only counter-clockwise turns on the stack

**Key Implementation Details:**

The cross product calculation (x₂ - x₁)(y₃ - y₂) - (y₂ - y₁)(x₃ - x₂) efficiently determines whether three points form a left or right turn - the core decision that builds the hull.

**Verification:**

Validated results against SciPy's ConvexHull implementation. Also computed geometric properties including area (Shoelace formula), perimeter, and compactness ratio.

**Applications:** Collision detection, pattern recognition, GIS, robotics path planning.

The convex hull: nature's way of drawing boundaries

Picture nails scattered on a board. Stretch a rubber band around them - that's your convex hull.

This visualization shows the Graham Scan algorithm in action:
→ Blue dots: 50 random points
→ Red boundary: the 12 points forming the hull
→ Green star: anchor point for polar angle sorting

The math is elegant:
Cross product > 0 means "turn left" (keep)
Cross product ≤ 0 means "turn right" (remove)

Time complexity: O(n log n)
