Ever wonder how particles "remember" where they came from? The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process models mean-reverting randomness: dX = θ(μ - X)dt + σdW

It always drifts back to equilibrium. Nature's rubber band!

The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process: a stochastic model where randomness has memory. Unlike pure Brownian motion, it pulls back toward a mean μ with rate θ.

Stationary distribution: N(μ, σ²/2θ)

Simulated 50 paths and verified the theoretical predictions match beautifully.

Brownian motion is completely random - it wanders forever without direction.

But what if randomness had a "home"?

The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process adds mean reversion. No matter how far it drifts, there's always a force pulling it back to equilibrium.

The math: dX = θ(μ - X)dt + σdW

Where θ controls how fast it snaps back. Used everywhere from physics (particle velocities) to finance (interest rates) to biology (population dynamics).

Simulated it in Python and the theory checks out perfectly!

Explored the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process today - a mean-reverting stochastic differential equation:

dX = θ(μ - X)dt + σdW

Key properties verified numerically:
- Mean: E[Xₜ] = μ + (x₀ - μ)e^(-θt)
- Variance: Var(Xₜ) = σ²/2θ · (1 - e^(-2θt))
- Stationary dist: N(μ, σ²/2θ)
- Autocovariance decays exponentially: e^(-θ|s|)

Half-life t₁/₂ = ln(2)/θ confirmed empirically. KS test passed for terminal distribution normality.

TITLE: I simulated the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and verified it statistically - here's what I learned about mean-reverting randomness

BODY:

**What is it?**

The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process is like Brownian motion with a rubber band attached. Regular Brownian motion wanders off forever, but OU always gets pulled back toward a central value.

**The equation (in plain terms):**

dX = θ(μ - X)dt + σdW

- θ (theta): How strong the rubber band is - higher means faster snap-back
- μ (mu): The "home" value it wants to return to
- σ (sigma): How much random noise there is
- dW: The random Brownian kicks

**ELI5 version:** Imagine a drunk person walking home. Regular Brownian motion = drunk person in an infinite field. OU process = drunk person in a valley - they stumble around randomly, but gravity always pulls them back toward the bottom.

**What I verified:**

1. The mean converges exponentially to μ with half-life = ln(2)/θ
2. Variance grows from 0 to σ²/(2θ) as the stationary limit
3. Terminal distribution passes Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test
4. Autocovariance decays exponentially as theory predicts

**Why it matters:**

- Physics: Models velocity of particles experiencing friction
- Finance: The Vasicek model for interest rates is exactly this
- Biology: Population sizes fluctuating around carrying capacity

Code uses numpy, scipy, and matplotlib. The "exact discretization" method gives perfect samples because we know the transition distribution analytically!

Randomness that remembers where home is!

The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is a beautiful piece of mathematics that describes how random systems bounce back to equilibrium.

Originally discovered in 1930 to explain how particles move through fluids, it's now used everywhere - from predicting interest rates to modeling how neurons fire.

I simulated 50 random paths and watched them all converge toward the mean. Math is satisfying when theory and simulation match perfectly!

Stochastic Process Implementation: Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Mean-Reverting Dynamics

I recently implemented and validated the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, a foundational stochastic differential equation with applications across quantitative finance, physics, and computational biology.

Technical highlights:

- Implemented exact discretization (not Euler-Maruyama approximation) since the OU transition density is analytically known
- Verified convergence: mean approaches equilibrium with half-life t = ln(2)/θ
- Validated stationary distribution N(μ, σ²/2θ) via Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
- Confirmed exponential autocovariance decay structure

The OU process is central to:
- Vasicek interest rate modeling
- Langevin dynamics in molecular simulation
- Mean-reverting volatility models
- Neural activity modeling

This exercise reinforced the importance of understanding analytical solutions - when you know the exact transition distribution, simulation becomes both more accurate and more efficient than naive discretization methods.

Mean-reverting randomness

Those colorful squiggly lines? They're 50 simulations of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process - random walks that always find their way home.

Unlike pure chaos, this process has memory. The gray band shows where theory predicts they'll be. And they listened!

Bottom right: histogram of where all paths ended up vs. the predicted bell curve.

Math describing reality = deeply satisfying

θ = 1.0 | μ = 0.0 | σ = 0.3
