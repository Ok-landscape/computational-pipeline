Can you turn a trefoil into a circle without cutting it? Math says NO.

The Jones polynomial proves it: V(t) = t + t³ - t⁴

Knot theory = topology meets algebra.

Knot theory asks: when are two loops fundamentally different?

The Jones polynomial assigns each knot a unique "fingerprint." For the trefoil: V(t) = t + t³ - t⁴

Even more remarkable: it can tell a knot from its mirror image. The Alexander polynomial cannot.

Here's something wild: mathematicians study knots - not the ones in your shoelaces, but loops in 3D space that can't be untangled.

The Jones polynomial (discovered in 1984, won a Fields Medal!) gives each knot a polynomial "signature."

Trefoil: V(t) = t + t³ - t⁴
Figure-eight: V(t) = t² - t + 1 - t⁻¹ + t⁻²

The figure-eight is special - it equals its mirror image (amphichiral). The trefoil? Completely different from its mirror!

Implemented Kauffman bracket and Jones polynomial computations in Python.

Key insight: Jones polynomial V(t) = (-A)⁻³ʷ × <D> where w = writhe and <D> is the Kauffman bracket.

Results for standard knots:
- Unknot: V(t) = 1
- Trefoil: V(t) = t + t³ - t⁴
- Figure-8: V(t) = t² - t + 1 - t⁻¹ + t⁻²

Mirror images K* satisfy: V_{K*}(t) = V_K(t⁻¹)

This distinguishes chiral knots unlike Alexander polynomials.

Title: I built a Python notebook exploring knot invariants - here's what I learned about the Jones polynomial

Body:

**TL;DR:** Knots aren't just for sailors - mathematicians use polynomial "fingerprints" to prove when two knots are fundamentally different.

**What are knot invariants?**

Imagine you have a tangled loop of rope. Can you untangle it into a simple circle without cutting? Knot theory studies this problem mathematically.

A **knot invariant** is something you can calculate from a knot that stays the same no matter how you wiggle it around. If two knots have different invariants, they CANNOT be the same knot.

**The Jones Polynomial**

Discovered in 1984 by Vaughan Jones (who won the Fields Medal for it!), the Jones polynomial assigns each knot a polynomial V(t).

Some examples:
- Unknot (simple circle): V(t) = 1
- Trefoil (simplest real knot): V(t) = t + t³ - t⁴
- Figure-eight knot: V(t) = t² - t + 1 - 1/t + 1/t²

**Cool fact:** The figure-eight knot equals its mirror image (called "amphichiral"). You can verify this because its Jones polynomial satisfies V(t) = V(1/t).

The trefoil is different from its mirror - the Jones polynomial catches this! The older Alexander polynomial (from 1923) cannot distinguish mirror images.

**What I implemented:**
- Laurent polynomial class for computations
- Kauffman bracket calculation via state-sum model
- Jones polynomial normalization
- Visualization of polynomials on the unit circle

**Open question:** Does V(t) = 1 guarantee a knot is the unknot? Nobody knows!

Ever wondered if math could prove you CAN'T untangle something?

Knot theory does exactly that! Mathematicians assign each knot a polynomial "signature" - if two knots have different signatures, they're definitely different knots.

The trefoil knot (that pretzel shape) has signature: t + t³ - t⁴

The figure-eight knot is special - it's identical to its mirror image. Most knots aren't!

Computational Topology: Implementing Knot Invariants in Python

I recently completed a computational exploration of knot invariants, implementing the Jones polynomial from first principles.

Key technical components:
- Laurent polynomial arithmetic (supporting negative exponents)
- Kauffman bracket computation via state-sum model
- Normalization using writhe correction: V(t) = (-A)⁻³ʷ × <D>
- Numerical evaluation and visualization on the complex unit circle

Mathematical insights:
- The Jones polynomial distinguishes chiral knots (a knot from its mirror image)
- Amphichiral knots like the figure-eight satisfy V(t) = V(t⁻¹)
- The Alexander polynomial (1923) predates Jones (1984) but cannot detect chirality

This project demonstrates skills in:
- Scientific Python (NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Algorithm implementation from mathematical definitions
- Data visualization for abstract mathematical objects
- Technical documentation in Jupyter notebooks

Applications of knot theory span DNA topology, quantum computing, and 3-manifold classification.

Knots, but make it math.

The Jones polynomial gives every knot a unique algebraic fingerprint.

Trefoil: t + t³ - t⁴
Figure-eight: t² - t + 1 - 1/t + 1/t²

Fun fact: The figure-eight knot looks IDENTICAL to its mirror image.

The trefoil? Completely different from its reflection. The Jones polynomial proves it.

This is why mathematicians study knots - to understand what transformations are truly impossible.
