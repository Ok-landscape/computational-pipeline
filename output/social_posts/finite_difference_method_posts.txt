Solved y'' - y = -x using finite differences!

Turn calculus into linear algebra: derivatives become (f(x+h) - 2f(x) + f(x-h))/h²

Achieved O(h²) convergence with 10⁻⁵ error using just 50 grid points.

Ever wonder how computers solve differential equations they can't integrate analytically?

The Finite Difference Method is beautifully simple: replace smooth derivatives with discrete differences.

For y'' - y = -x, I approximated the second derivative as:
(y_{i+1} - 2y_i + y_{i-1})/h²

This turns calculus into a tridiagonal linear system Ay = b that NumPy solves instantly.

With 50 grid points, the maximum error was ~10⁻⁵, and halving the step size reduces error by 4x. That's the power of O(h²) convergence!

Implemented the Finite Difference Method for solving boundary value problems in Python.

Problem: y'' - y = -x with y(0) = y(1) = 0
Analytical solution: y(x) = x - sinh(x)/sinh(1)

Using central differences:
• First derivative: [f(x+h) - f(x-h)]/(2h)
• Second derivative: [f(x+h) - 2f(x) + f(x-h)]/h²

Results with N=50 interior points:
• Max error: 10⁻⁵
• Convergence rate: 2.0 (as expected for O(h²))

The tridiagonal system has condition number ~1000, ensuring numerical stability.

**Title:** How to Solve Differential Equations with Python: Finite Difference Method Explained

**Body:**

I created a Jupyter notebook demonstrating the Finite Difference Method (FDM) - a fundamental numerical technique for solving differential equations that can't be solved analytically.

**The Basic Idea (ELI5):**

Imagine you want to find a curve, but you only know rules about how the curve bends. Calculus gives us derivatives to describe this bending, but computers can't do calculus directly.

FDM's trick: approximate the "bendiness" (derivative) by looking at nearby points. If you know y at x-h, x, and x+h, you can estimate y'' as:

y'' ≈ (y(x+h) - 2y(x) + y(x-h)) / h²

**What the notebook covers:**

1. Taylor series derivation of forward, backward, and central differences
2. Setting up the tridiagonal matrix system Ay = b
3. Solving y'' - y = -x with boundary conditions y(0) = y(1) = 0
4. Convergence analysis showing O(h²) error reduction

**Key results:**

- With 50 interior grid points: max error ≈ 10⁻⁵
- Doubling grid points → error drops by factor of 4
- Convergence rate measured at 2.0 (confirming second-order accuracy)

**What I learned:**

The beauty of FDM is how it converts calculus into linear algebra. The resulting tridiagonal matrix is sparse and well-conditioned, making it efficient to solve even for large grids.

How do computers solve equations that have no exact solution?

One powerful method: Finite Differences!

Instead of working with smooth curves, we use a grid of points. We approximate how the curve "bends" by comparing neighboring values.

I just built a Python notebook that solves y'' - y = -x this way. With only 50 grid points, the answer is accurate to 0.00001!

The visualization shows the solution, error distribution, and proof that finer grids give exponentially better results.

Numerical Methods in Practice: Implementing the Finite Difference Method

I recently developed a computational notebook demonstrating the Finite Difference Method (FDM) for solving boundary value problems - a foundational technique in scientific computing and engineering simulation.

**Technical Approach:**

The notebook solves y'' - y = -x with Dirichlet boundary conditions by:
• Discretizing the domain into N interior grid points
• Approximating the second derivative using central differences: O(h²) truncation error
• Constructing a tridiagonal linear system Ay = b
• Solving efficiently using scipy.linalg.solve

**Quantitative Results:**

• Grid: 50 interior points
• Maximum error: 10⁻⁵
• Verified second-order convergence rate (2.0)
• Matrix condition number: ~1000 (numerically stable)

**Skills Demonstrated:**

• Numerical analysis and error quantification
• Scientific Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)
• Algorithm implementation from mathematical foundations
• Convergence analysis and validation against analytical solutions

This methodology extends to heat transfer, structural mechanics, and fluid dynamics simulations.

From calculus to code

The Finite Difference Method turns impossible equations into solvable ones.

The secret? Approximate derivatives using nearby grid points.

y'' ≈ (y_{i+1} - 2y_i + y_{i-1})/h²

This transforms a differential equation into a matrix equation that Python solves instantly.

Results:
• 50 grid points
• Error: 0.00001
• Second-order convergence

Swipe to see the solution curve, error analysis, and the beautiful tridiagonal matrix structure that makes it all work.
