Ever wonder how symmetry becomes math? Group representation theory turns abstract symmetries into matrices we can compute!

S₃ has 3 irreps: dims 1, 1, 2
1² + 1² + 2² = 6 = |S₃|

Group representation theory bridges abstract algebra and linear algebra by representing group elements as matrices.

Key insight: For any finite group G, the sum of squared dimensions of irreducible representations equals |G|.

Verified computationally for S₃, Z₆, and D₄.

What if you could turn abstract symmetry into something you can calculate?

That's group representation theory! It maps group elements to matrices while preserving structure.

I implemented representations for:
- S₃ (permutations of 3 objects)
- Z₆ (cyclic group)
- D₄ (square symmetries)

The character table is like a fingerprint for the group. Rows = representations, columns = conjugacy classes, entries = traces.

And they satisfy beautiful orthogonality relations!

Implemented group representation theory from scratch in Python!

A representation ρ: G → GL(V) is a homomorphism preserving group structure:
ρ(g₁·g₂) = ρ(g₁)ρ(g₂)

Key results verified:
- Character orthogonality: ⟨χᵢ, χⱼ⟩ = δᵢⱼ
- Dimension formula: Σdᵢ² = |G|
- Schur's lemma implications

Built character tables for S₃, Z₆, and D₄. The math checks out!

**Title:** I implemented Group Representation Theory in Python - here's how symmetry becomes linear algebra

**Body:**

I built a computational exploration of group representation theory - the mathematical framework that turns abstract symmetries into matrices we can actually compute with.

**What I implemented:**

1. **Symmetric Group S₃** - All permutations of 3 elements
   - Computed conjugacy classes
   - Built 3 irreducible representations (trivial, sign, standard 2D)
   - Verified: 1² + 1² + 2² = 6 = |S₃|

2. **Cyclic Group Z₆** - Integers mod 6
   - All irreps are 1-dimensional
   - Uses roots of unity: ρₖ(j) = e^(2πikj/6)

3. **Dihedral Group D₄** - Symmetries of a square
   - 8 elements (4 rotations + 4 reflections)
   - 5 irreps with dims 1,1,1,1,2

**Key math verified:**

The character orthogonality relations are beautiful:
⟨χᵢ, χⱼ⟩ = (1/|G|) Σ χᵢ(g)·χⱼ(g) = δᵢⱼ

This means characters of different irreps are orthogonal - like basis vectors in a vector space!

**Why this matters:**

Representation theory is everywhere:
- Quantum mechanics (angular momentum, selection rules)
- Chemistry (molecular orbitals, spectroscopy)
- Particle physics (the Standard Model uses SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1))

The notebook includes visualizations of character tables and D₄ acting on a square.

Ever heard that math is the language of symmetry? Group representation theory makes this literal!

It turns abstract symmetries (like rotating a square or shuffling cards) into matrices you can multiply and analyze.

I built a Python notebook exploring this for three groups:
- Permutations (S₃)
- Clock arithmetic (Z₆)
- Square symmetries (D₄)

The punchline? Characters of irreducible representations are orthogonal - like perpendicular axes in space!

Mathematical foundations of symmetry: A computational exploration of Group Representation Theory

I developed a Python implementation demonstrating how abstract algebraic structures (groups) can be concretely realized as matrix transformations.

**Technical Implementation:**

Built from scratch:
- Group multiplication tables and conjugacy class computation
- Matrix representations for S₃, Z₆, and D₄
- Character table construction
- Orthogonality relation verification

**Key Mathematical Results Verified:**

1. Representation homomorphism: ρ(g₁g₂) = ρ(g₁)ρ(g₂)
2. First orthogonality: ⟨χᵢ, χⱼ⟩ = δᵢⱼ
3. Dimension formula: Σdᵢ² = |G|

**Industry Applications:**

This theory underlies:
- Quantum computing gate design
- Molecular symmetry analysis in drug discovery
- Signal processing and Fourier transforms
- Machine learning equivariant networks

**Skills Demonstrated:** Python, NumPy, Mathematical Modeling, Algorithm Design, Scientific Visualization

Group representation theory turns abstract symmetry into matrices.

The wild part? Different representations are "perpendicular" to each other in a precise mathematical sense.

From crystals to quantum mechanics to particle physics - this is the language nature speaks.
