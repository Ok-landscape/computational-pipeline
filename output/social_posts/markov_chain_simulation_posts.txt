Ever wonder how weather forecasts work? Markov chains! The future depends only on NOW, not history.

Simulated 1000 steps → empirical distribution matched theory perfectly.

Exploring Markov chains: stochastic processes where the future depends only on the present state.

Built a weather model with 3 states (Sunny/Cloudy/Rainy). After 1000 simulated steps, the empirical distribution converged beautifully to the analytical stationary distribution π.

Just built a Markov chain simulator and it's SO satisfying to watch probability theory come alive!

The concept is elegant: where you go next depends ONLY on where you are now - not your history. It's "memoryless."

I modeled weather patterns with a 3x3 transition matrix. After simulating 1000 steps, the time spent in each state (Sunny: 43%, Cloudy: 30%, Rainy: 27%) matched the mathematical prediction almost perfectly.

The convergence visualization is *chef's kiss*

Implemented a discrete-time Markov chain simulation in Python.

Key concepts demonstrated:
• Transition matrix P where ∑ⱼ pᵢⱼ = 1
• Stationary distribution π satisfying πP = π
• Chapman-Kolmogorov equation: P(n-step) = Pⁿ

Weather model results:
- Analytical π: [0.432, 0.297, 0.270]
- Empirical (n=1000): nearly identical

Verified that for irreducible, aperiodic chains, lim(n→∞) Pⁿ converges to rows of π regardless of initial state.

**Title:** I built a Markov Chain simulator to understand stationary distributions - here's what I learned

**Body:**

Hey everyone! Just finished implementing a Markov chain simulation and wanted to share some insights.

**What's a Markov Chain?**

Think of it as a system that hops between states, where the probability of your next state depends ONLY on where you are right now - not how you got there. It's called the "memoryless" property.

**What I Built**

A simple weather model with 3 states: Sunny, Cloudy, and Rainy. The transition matrix looks like:

```
         Sunny  Cloudy  Rainy
Sunny    [0.7    0.2    0.1]
Cloudy   [0.3    0.4    0.3]
Rainy    [0.2    0.3    0.5]
```

**The Cool Part**

There's this thing called a "stationary distribution" - a probability vector π where πP = π. Once the system runs long enough, it settles into spending predictable fractions of time in each state.

I computed it two ways:
1. **Analytically**: Solving the eigenvector equation
2. **Empirically**: Running 1000 steps and counting

Results:
- Sunny: ~43%
- Cloudy: ~30%
- Rainy: ~27%

Both methods matched almost perfectly! The max error was tiny.

**Key Insight**

No matter where you START (all sunny, all rainy, etc.), the system converges to the same stationary distribution. That's the power of irreducible, aperiodic Markov chains.

Happy to answer questions about the implementation!

Ever notice how weather apps predict tomorrow but not next month? That's because weather behaves like a Markov chain!

The "memoryless" property means: what happens next depends only on NOW, not yesterday.

I built a simulation modeling Sunny/Cloudy/Rainy transitions. After 1000 steps, the system settled into a stable pattern matching the math perfectly:
- Sunny: 43%
- Cloudy: 30%
- Rainy: 27%

**Markov Chain Simulation: Bridging Theory and Practice**

Just completed a computational project demonstrating Markov chain dynamics - a fundamental concept in stochastic processes with applications across finance, NLP, genetics, and operations research.

**Technical Implementation:**

• Built a discrete-time Markov chain simulator using NumPy and SciPy
• Modeled a 3-state weather system with a stochastic transition matrix
• Computed stationary distributions both analytically (eigenvector decomposition) and empirically (Monte Carlo simulation)
• Visualized convergence behavior from multiple initial conditions

**Key Results:**

The empirical distribution from 1000 simulated steps matched the analytical stationary distribution to high precision, validating the implementation and demonstrating the convergence theorem for irreducible, aperiodic chains.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Linear algebra (eigenvector computation)
- Probability theory
- Scientific Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)
- Data visualization
- Mathematical modeling

Markov chains are everywhere

From autocomplete to stock markets to DNA sequencing - this "memoryless" process powers so much of modern tech.

The rule is simple:
Where you go next depends ONLY on where you are now

I simulated 1000 weather transitions and watched the math come alive. The system naturally settled into spending:

43% Sunny
30% Cloudy
27% Rainy

Exactly what the equations predicted.
