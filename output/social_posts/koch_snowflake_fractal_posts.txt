The Koch snowflake: infinite complexity from simple rules.

Start with a triangle → recursively add triangles to each edge.

Result: Perimeter → ∞ while area converges to 8A₀/5.

Fractal dimension D ≈ 1.2619 (more than a line, less than a plane).

Implemented in Python with complex arithmetic.

Ever seen a shape that has infinite perimeter but finite area? Meet the Koch snowflake.

The construction is deceptively simple:
1. Start with an equilateral triangle
2. Add a smaller triangle to the middle of each edge
3. Repeat forever

After n iterations: perimeter grows as (4/3)ⁿ → ∞

But the area? It converges to exactly 8/5 of the original triangle.

The fractal dimension D = ln(4)/ln(3) ≈ 1.26 captures this weird in-between nature.

Python makes it easy with complex number rotations for the geometry.

Implemented the Koch snowflake fractal in Python using complex number arithmetic.

Key mathematical properties:
• Perimeter: Lₙ = L₀·(4/3)ⁿ → ∞
• Area: Converges to A∞ = 8A₀/5
• Fractal dimension: D = ln(4)/ln(3) ≈ 1.2619
• Segments per iteration: Nₙ = 3·4ⁿ

The elegant part: using e^(iπ/3) rotation for constructing the equilateral triangle peaks.

Self-similarity at all scales - zoom in anywhere and you see the same structure.

**Title:** I implemented the Koch Snowflake fractal in Python - here's the math behind a shape with infinite perimeter but finite area

**Body:**

I built a visualization of the Koch snowflake fractal and wanted to share both the code approach and the fascinating mathematics.

**The Construction**

You start with an equilateral triangle, then for each edge:
1. Divide it into three equal parts
2. Build an equilateral triangle on the middle third (pointing outward)
3. Remove the base
4. Repeat on all new edges

**The Paradox**

Here's what's wild:
- **Perimeter** grows as (4/3)ⁿ per iteration → infinity
- **Area** converges to exactly 8/5 of the original triangle

So you have infinite boundary enclosing finite space.

**The Fractal Dimension**

The Hausdorff dimension is D = ln(4)/ln(3) ≈ 1.2619

This non-integer dimension tells you it's "more than a line but less than a plane" - it fills space more than 1D but doesn't cover 2D.

**Python Implementation**

I used complex numbers for the geometry - multiplying by e^(iπ/3) gives you the 60° rotation needed for equilateral triangles. Much cleaner than trig functions.

The recursive function builds each Koch curve segment, then three of them form the snowflake.

**Interactive Notebook**

You can view and run the full code here:

**What I Learned**

- Complex number arithmetic elegantly handles 2D rotations
- Self-similarity means the same pattern at every zoom level
- Simple recursive rules can generate infinite complexity

Happy to answer questions about the implementation or math!

One of the most beautiful paradoxes in mathematics: the Koch snowflake.

This shape has an INFINITE perimeter wrapped around a FINITE area. How?

Start with a triangle. Add bumps to every edge. Repeat forever. The boundary keeps growing but the area converges to exactly 8/5 of the original.

The fractal dimension ≈ 1.26 means it's "more than a line, less than a plane."

I visualized all this in Python. Check it out:

Exploring Fractal Geometry Through Python: The Koch Snowflake

I recently implemented a visualization of the Koch snowflake, one of the foundational fractals in mathematics. The project demonstrates several key technical concepts:

**Mathematical Implementation**
- Used complex number arithmetic for geometric transformations, leveraging Euler's formula (e^(iπ/3)) for 60° rotations
- Recursive algorithm with clear base case and reduction steps
- Verification of theoretical predictions: perimeter growth (4/3)ⁿ and area convergence to 8A₀/5

**Key Insight: The Fractal Dimension**
D = ln(4)/ln(3) ≈ 1.2619

This non-integer dimension quantifies how the Koch curve fills space - critical for applications in analyzing coastlines, market patterns, and natural phenomena.

**Technical Skills Demonstrated**
- NumPy for numerical computation
- Matplotlib for scientific visualization
- Recursive algorithm design
- Mathematical modeling and verification

The project illustrates how simple rules generate complex emergent behavior - a principle applicable across domains from computer graphics to quantitative analysis.

Infinite perimeter.
Finite area.
No, really.

The Koch snowflake is one of math's most beautiful paradoxes.

Start with a triangle.
Add a bump to every edge.
Repeat forever.

The boundary grows without bound...
but the area converges to exactly 8/5 of the original.

Fractal dimension ≈ 1.26
(More than a line. Less than a plane.)

Zoom in anywhere and you see the same pattern. That's self-similarity - the hallmark of fractals.

Built with Python using complex number rotations.
