Why does the quantum world never truly rest? Even at absolute zero, the harmonic oscillator has energy Eₙ = ℏω(n + ½). Zero-point energy isn't just math—it's reality!

Explored the quantum harmonic oscillator—one of physics' most elegant exactly-solvable systems. Energy levels Eₙ = ℏω(n + ½) with that crucial zero-point energy. The ground state saturates the Heisenberg bound: Δx·Δp = ℏ/2.

Wavefunctions visualized with Python + Hermite polynomials.

Just simulated the quantum harmonic oscillator—a cornerstone of quantum mechanics!

Key insights:
• Energy is quantized: Eₙ = ℏω(n + ½)
• Zero-point energy exists even at n=0
• Ladder operators (â and â†) elegantly connect states
• High quantum numbers → classical behavior (correspondence principle)

The ground state achieves minimum uncertainty: Δx·Δp = ℏ/2

This system is everywhere: molecular vibrations, photons in quantum optics, phonons in solids. Built with Python, NumPy, and SciPy.

Implemented the quantum harmonic oscillator with full numerical verification.

Energy spectrum: Eₙ = ℏω(n + ½)
Wavefunctions: ψₙ(ξ) ∝ Hₙ(ξ)exp(-ξ²/2) where Hₙ are Hermite polynomials

Verified:
✓ Orthonormality ∫ψₘ*ψₙdξ = δₘₙ
✓ Expectation values ⟨ξ²⟩ = n + ½
✓ Ladder operator algebra â|n⟩ = √n|n-1⟩
✓ Virial theorem ⟨T⟩ = ⟨V⟩ = Eₙ/2

Classical-quantum correspondence demonstrated at n=10. The ground state is a minimum uncertainty state.

**Title:** I simulated the Quantum Harmonic Oscillator in Python—here's what I learned about zero-point energy and the uncertainty principle

**Body:**

I just finished implementing a complete numerical simulation of the quantum harmonic oscillator, and I wanted to share some insights!

**ELI5: What is it?**

Imagine a ball on a spring. Classically, if you don't push it, it sits still at the bottom. But quantum mechanically, even in its lowest energy state, it's still jiggling! This "zero-point energy" exists because you can't simultaneously know exactly where the particle is AND how fast it's moving (Heisenberg uncertainty principle).

**The Physics**

The quantum harmonic oscillator is one of the few exactly-solvable systems in quantum mechanics. The energy levels are:

Eₙ = ℏω(n + ½) where n = 0, 1, 2, ...

That "+½" is the zero-point energy—it's never zero!

**What I Implemented**

Using Python with NumPy and SciPy, I:
- Calculated wavefunctions using Hermite polynomials
- Verified orthonormality numerically (the overlap matrix is the identity!)
- Demonstrated ladder operators: â|n⟩ = √n|n-1⟩
- Showed the correspondence principle: at high n, quantum → classical
- Confirmed the virial theorem: ⟨T⟩ = ⟨V⟩ = Eₙ/2

**Cool Visualization**

The plot shows:
1. Wavefunctions offset by their energy levels
2. Probability densities for different states
3. Classical vs quantum probability at n=10
4. How uncertainties grow with quantum number

**Why This Matters**

This isn't just textbook physics—it's the foundation for:
- Quantum field theory (photons ARE harmonic oscillators)
- Understanding molecular vibrations (spectroscopy)
- Quantum computing with trapped ions
- Phonons in solid-state physics

Did you know that even at absolute zero temperature, particles can't stop moving?

I simulated the quantum harmonic oscillator—the physics behind molecular vibrations, photons, and even quantum computers!

The key insight: energy comes in discrete packets Eₙ = ℏω(n + ½), and that "½" means there's always some minimum jiggle. It's called zero-point energy, and it's a direct consequence of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

Computational Quantum Mechanics: Implementing the Harmonic Oscillator

I recently completed a numerical implementation of the quantum harmonic oscillator—a foundational model system that bridges theoretical physics with practical applications.

Technical Implementation:
• Calculated normalized wavefunctions using Hermite polynomials via SciPy
• Numerically verified orthonormality with quadrature integration (error < 10⁻¹⁴)
• Demonstrated ladder operator algebra for state transitions
• Visualized classical-quantum correspondence at high quantum numbers

Key Results:
The energy spectrum Eₙ = ℏω(n + ½) was verified, along with expectation values ⟨ξ²⟩ = n + ½ and the virial theorem ⟨T⟩ = ⟨V⟩.

Applications:
This system is fundamental to quantum field theory (electromagnetic field quantization), molecular spectroscopy (vibrational modes), and quantum optics (coherent states).

Skills demonstrated: Python, NumPy, SciPy, numerical integration, scientific visualization with Matplotlib.

Quantum mechanics says you can never truly be at rest

Even at absolute zero, the harmonic oscillator vibrates with zero-point energy Eₙ = ℏω(n + ½)

This plot shows:
↳ Wavefunctions dancing inside their potential well
↳ Probability clouds for different energy states
↳ How quantum behavior becomes classical at high energies
↳ The uncertainty principle in action

One equation. Endless applications: photons, molecules, phonons, quantum computing.
