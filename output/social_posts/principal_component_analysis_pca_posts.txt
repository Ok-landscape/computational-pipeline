Let's talk about one of the most elegant techniques in data science: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Imagine you have data with 100 features. PCA finds the directions where your data varies most, letting you reduce to just a few dimensions while keeping most information.

The math is beautiful: find eigenvectors of the covariance matrix C = XᵀX/(n-1)

In our Python demo, just 2 principal components captured 87% of the variance from 4 features!

Perfect for visualization and noise reduction.

Implemented PCA from scratch in Python using eigendecomposition.

The core algorithm:
1. Center data: X - μ
2. Compute covariance: C = XᵀX/(n-1)
3. Eigendecomposition: Cv = λv
4. Project: Z = XVₖ

Key insight: eigenvalues λᵢ represent variance explained by each component. Ratio = λᵢ/Σλⱼ

Results: PC1 captured 54%, PC2 captured 33% → 87% cumulative with just 2 components.

Loadings heatmap reveals which features drive each PC.

**Title:** [OC] Implemented Principal Component Analysis from scratch in Python - visualizing how PCA finds directions of maximum variance

**Body:**

I created a Jupyter notebook implementing PCA from the ground up to really understand how dimensionality reduction works. Here's what I learned:

**The Core Idea (ELI5):**

Imagine you have a cloud of data points in 3D space, but most of them lie roughly on a flat plane. PCA finds that plane automatically by looking for the directions where your data "spreads out" the most.

**The Math (simplified):**

1. Center your data by subtracting the mean
2. Compute the covariance matrix: C = XᵀX/(n-1)
3. Find eigenvectors and eigenvalues: Cv = λv
4. The eigenvectors ARE your principal components
5. Eigenvalues tell you how much variance each PC captures

**My Results:**

Generated 4D synthetic data with known correlation structure. PCA found:
- PC1: 54% of variance
- PC2: 33% of variance
- PC1 + PC2: 87% total!

This means we can represent most of the information in just 2 dimensions.

**The Visualization:**

The plot shows:
- Original data with PC directions as arrows
- Data transformed to PC space
- Scree plot (variance explained)
- Loadings heatmap (feature contributions)

**What's Cool:**

The loadings reveal which original features "load onto" each PC. Feature 1 dominated PC1 (loading: 0.74) while the combination of Features 1-2 shaped PC2.

How do computers find patterns in complex data? One powerful technique is Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

Think of it like this: if you photographed a 3D object, you'd want the angle that shows the most detail. PCA automatically finds the "best angles" for your data.

I built a Python notebook that implements PCA from scratch. The result? We compressed 4-dimensional data down to 2 dimensions while keeping 87% of the information!

Demystifying Principal Component Analysis: A From-Scratch Implementation

As part of my computational research pipeline, I implemented PCA using pure linear algebra to deeply understand this fundamental dimensionality reduction technique.

**Technical Approach:**

PCA identifies orthogonal directions of maximum variance through eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix. The algorithm:
- Centers data and computes C = XᵀX/(n-1)
- Solves Cv = λv for eigenpairs
- Projects data onto top k eigenvectors

**Key Results:**

Using synthetic 4D multivariate normal data with defined correlation structure:
- First principal component: 54% variance explained
- Second component: 33% variance explained
- Two components sufficient to retain 87% of total variance

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Linear algebra fundamentals (eigendecomposition)
- Scientific Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)
- Data visualization and interpretation
- Algorithm implementation from mathematical foundations

This exercise reinforced why PCA remains essential for exploratory data analysis, feature extraction, and preprocessing in machine learning pipelines.
