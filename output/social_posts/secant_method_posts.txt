The Secant Method finds roots WITHOUT derivatives! It approximates f'(x) using finite differences:

x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n)·(x_n - x_{n-1})/(f(x_n) - f(x_{n-1}))

Converges at the golden ratio φ ≈ 1.618

Exploring the Secant Method: a clever root-finding algorithm that skips derivative computation by using secant lines instead.

Convergence order? The golden ratio φ = (1+√5)/2 ≈ 1.618

Found √2 in just 6 iterations with 10⁻¹⁵ precision.

Ever needed to find where f(x) = 0 but didn't want to compute derivatives?

The Secant Method has you covered! Instead of using f'(x) like Newton's method, it approximates the slope using two points:

f'(x) ≈ (f(x_n) - f(x_{n-1})) / (x_n - x_{n-1})

The beautiful part? It converges at the golden ratio φ ≈ 1.618 - not as fast as Newton (order 2) but way faster than bisection (order 1).

Found √2 to 15 decimal places in just 6 iterations!

Implemented the Secant Method for root finding in Python.

Key insight: Replace Newton's derivative with a finite difference approximation:

x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n)·(x_n - x_{n-1})/(f(x_n) - f(x_{n-1}))

Convergence analysis confirms order p = φ ≈ 1.618 (golden ratio).

Test results:
- √2: 6 iterations, error < 10⁻¹⁵
- x - cos(x) = 0: 6 iterations

Trade-off: One function eval per iteration vs Newton's two (f and f'), but slower convergence.

**Title:** Implemented the Secant Method in Python - Here's why its convergence rate is the Golden Ratio

**Body:**

I just built a Python implementation of the Secant Method for root finding, and the math behind it is fascinating!

**The Problem:** You want to solve f(x) = 0 but computing derivatives is expensive or impossible.

**The Solution:** Instead of Newton's method (which needs f'(x)), approximate the derivative using two points:

f'(x) ≈ (f(x_n) - f(x_{n-1})) / (x_n - x_{n-1})

This gives us the iteration formula:
x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n) · (x_n - x_{n-1}) / (f(x_n) - f(x_{n-1}))

**Why it works:** Geometrically, you're drawing a line through two points on the curve and finding where it crosses zero. That's your next guess!

**The cool part:** The convergence order is φ = (1 + √5)/2 ≈ 1.618 - literally the golden ratio! This means:
- Faster than bisection (order 1)
- Slower than Newton (order 2)
- But only ONE function evaluation per iteration

**Results:**
- Finding √2: Converged in 6 iterations to 15 decimal places
- Finding root of x - cos(x) = 0: Also 6 iterations

The visualization shows how secant lines progressively approach the root. Pretty elegant!

Just explored a clever math trick: the Secant Method!

Imagine you need to find where a curve crosses zero, but calculating slopes is too hard. Solution? Draw a line through two nearby points and see where IT crosses zero. Repeat until you nail it!

The wild part - this method converges at the golden ratio φ ≈ 1.618. Found √2 to 15 decimal places in just 6 steps!

Numerical Methods Deep Dive: The Secant Method

Just completed an implementation of the Secant Method for root-finding problems - a technique that elegantly balances computational efficiency with convergence speed.

Key Technical Insights:

The method approximates derivatives using finite differences, transforming Newton-Raphson's formula into a derivative-free algorithm. This is particularly valuable when:
- Analytical derivatives are unavailable
- Function evaluations are expensive
- Working with black-box systems

Performance Analysis:
- Convergence order: φ ≈ 1.618 (the golden ratio)
- Function evaluations per iteration: 1 (vs Newton's 2)
- Test case (√2): 6 iterations to machine precision

The implementation includes comprehensive error analysis, geometric visualization of the secant line construction, and convergence order verification.

Trade-offs to consider:
- Requires two initial guesses (vs one for Newton)
- No guaranteed convergence (vs bisection)
- Superlinear but not quadratic convergence

Skills demonstrated: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, numerical analysis, algorithm implementation, technical documentation.

The Secant Method: Finding roots without derivatives

What you're seeing: Secant lines converging to √2

The idea is beautifully simple:
Draw a line through two points on a curve
Find where it hits zero
That's your new guess
Repeat

Why it's special:
- No calculus needed
- Converges at the golden ratio φ ≈ 1.618
- Found √2 in just 6 steps

Sometimes the elegant solution isn't the most complex one.
