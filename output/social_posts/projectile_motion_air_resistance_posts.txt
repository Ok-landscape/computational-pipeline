Why does a baseball fall short of textbook predictions? Air resistance!

Explored projectile motion with air resistance using numerical simulation.

Key findings: quadratic drag (F = -bv²) reduces range significantly, creates asymmetric trajectories, and shifts optimal launch angle below 45°.

Solved using scipy.integrate.solve_ivp with RK45 method.

Ever wonder why real projectiles don't follow those perfect parabolas from physics class?

I built a Python simulation to compare ideal vs realistic trajectories with air resistance.

The results are striking:
- Range reduced by ~40%
- Max height drops noticeably
- Descent is steeper than ascent
- Optimal angle shifts below 45°

The drag force depends on v², making it highly nonlinear. At high speeds, even small velocity increases cause huge drag increases.

This is why understanding drag matters in sports, ballistics, and aerospace!

New computational notebook: Projectile Motion with Air Resistance

Implemented quadratic drag model where F_drag = -b|v|v and solved the coupled ODEs:

dvₓ/dt = -γv·vₓ
dvᵧ/dt = -g - γv·vᵧ

where γ = b/m and v = √(vₓ² + vᵧ²)

Used scipy.integrate.solve_ivp (RK45) with terminal velocity parameterization: γ = g/v_t²

Results show ~40% range reduction, asymmetric trajectory, and optimal launch angle < 45°.

Code is self-contained NumPy/SciPy/Matplotlib.

**Title:** I built a Python simulation comparing projectile motion with and without air resistance - here's what I learned

**Body:**

I created a Jupyter notebook to explore how air resistance affects projectile motion, and the results really helped me understand why real-world physics differs so much from idealized textbook problems.

**The Problem:**
Textbooks usually ignore air resistance, giving us the simple parabolic trajectory. But real projectiles experience quadratic drag proportional to v². I wanted to see exactly how much this matters.

**What I Built:**
- Used scipy.integrate.solve_ivp with RK45 method to solve the coupled differential equations
- Modeled drag as F = -b|v|v (quadratic in velocity)
- Parameterized drag using terminal velocity (for a baseball, about 35 m/s)

**Key Findings:**

1. **Range reduced by ~40%** - A 50 m/s projectile at 45° travels much shorter with drag
2. **Asymmetric trajectory** - The descent is steeper than ascent because gravity and drag oppose each other differently going up vs down
3. **Optimal angle shifts below 45°** - Lower angles mean less time in the air = less cumulative drag
4. **Speed is capped by terminal velocity** - You can't exceed v_t during descent

**ELI5 Version:**
Imagine throwing a ball through honey vs air. The honey slows it down more when it's moving fast. Air does the same thing, just less dramatically. This "slowing down" force grows with the square of speed, so fast-moving objects get hit much harder by drag.

**The Code:**
Everything is self-contained using NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. The ODE system tracks position (x, y) and velocity (vₓ, vᵧ) as a 4-element state vector.

Happy to answer questions about the implementation or physics!

Why don't real projectiles follow perfect parabolas?

I simulated projectile motion with air resistance and discovered some fascinating physics:

- Range drops by ~40% compared to vacuum
- The path becomes asymmetric (steeper descent)
- Optimal launch angle is LESS than 45°

This explains why athletes, engineers, and ballistics experts can't just use simple textbook equations - real air creates drag that grows with speed squared!

Computational Physics in Practice: Projectile Motion with Air Resistance

Just completed a numerical simulation project exploring how quadratic drag affects projectile trajectories - a classic problem with real-world applications in sports physics, aerospace engineering, and ballistics.

**Technical Approach:**
- Formulated coupled ODEs for position and velocity with drag force F = -b|v|v
- Implemented solution using scipy.integrate.solve_ivp with RK45 (Runge-Kutta) method
- Parameterized drag through terminal velocity for physical intuition

**Key Quantitative Results:**
- ~40% reduction in range compared to ideal case
- Asymmetric trajectory due to different drag-gravity interactions during ascent vs descent
- Optimal launch angle shifts below the classical 45°

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Numerical methods for nonlinear differential equations
- Scientific Python stack (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)
- Physics modeling and parameterization
- Data visualization for scientific communication

This methodology extends naturally to more complex scenarios: wind effects, Magnus force (spin), altitude-dependent density.

The physics your textbook didn't tell you about

Why real projectiles don't follow perfect parabolas:

AIR RESISTANCE

I simulated what actually happens when you throw something through air instead of a vacuum.

The results:
→ Range drops ~40%
→ Path becomes asymmetric
→ Optimal angle < 45°
→ Speed capped by terminal velocity

The drag force grows with velocity SQUARED - so fast objects experience dramatically more resistance.

This is why sports physics, ballistics, and aerospace engineering can't ignore the air.

Built with Python, NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.
