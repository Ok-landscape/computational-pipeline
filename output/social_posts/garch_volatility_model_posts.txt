Just implemented a GARCH(1,1) model from scratch in Python! Volatility clustering is real: σ²ₜ = ω + αε²ₜ₋₁ + βσ²ₜ₋₁. With α+β ≈ 0.95, shocks persist for months. Essential for risk management. #Python #Quant #Finance #DataScience

### Bluesky (300 chars)
Built a GARCH(1,1) volatility model from first principles. The key insight: market volatility clusters—high volatility follows high volatility. The variance equation σ²ₜ = ω + αε²ₜ₋₁ + βσ²ₜ₋₁ captures this beautifully. Parameter estimation via maximum likelihood in pure Python/NumPy.

### Threads (500 chars)
Ever notice how market turbulence comes in waves? That's volatility clustering, and GARCH models capture it perfectly.

I just implemented a GARCH(1,1) model from scratch:
σ²ₜ = ω + αε²ₜ₋₁ + βσ²ₜ₋₁

The persistence (α+β ≈ 0.95) means a volatility shock today still affects markets months later!

The news impact curve shows how both positive and negative shocks increase future volatility symmetrically. Fat tails in returns? GARCH explains them.

Pure Python implementation—no black boxes.

### Mastodon (500 chars)
Implemented GARCH(1,1) for volatility modeling from scratch.

The variance recursion: σ²ₜ = ω + αε²ₜ₋₁ + βσ²ₜ₋₁

Key findings:
- Estimated parameters match true values closely
- Persistence α+β ≈ 0.95 indicates highly persistent volatility shocks
- Unconditional variance: E[σ²ₜ] = ω/(1-α-β)
- Half-life of shocks: log(0.5)/log(α+β)

Maximum likelihood estimation with L-BFGS-B optimization. Standardized residuals show proper mean=0, std=1, confirming model adequacy.

**Title:** I built a GARCH(1,1) volatility model from scratch in Python - here's what I learned about why market turbulence comes in waves

**Body:**

I've been studying financial econometrics and wanted to really understand GARCH models, so I implemented one from first principles using only NumPy and SciPy.

**What is GARCH?**

GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) models time-varying volatility. The key observation is that volatility clusters—big market moves tend to follow big market moves.

**The Math (in Unicode since Reddit doesn't render LaTeX):**

The GARCH(1,1) variance equation:
σ²ₜ = ω + αε²ₜ₋₁ + βσ²ₜ₋₁

Where:
- ω > 0: baseline variance
- α ≥ 0: ARCH effect (how yesterday's shock affects today's variance)
- β ≥ 0: GARCH effect (persistence of variance)
- α + β < 1: stationarity condition

**What I implemented:**

1. Simulation function to generate synthetic GARCH returns
2. Maximum likelihood estimation to recover parameters
3. Volatility forecasting that reverts to long-run average

**Key results:**

- My estimated parameters matched the true simulation values closely
- Persistence (α+β) ≈ 0.95 means volatility shocks are very persistent
- The unconditional variance is ω/(1-α-β)
- Returns show excess kurtosis (fat tails) even with normal innovations

**The "aha" moment:**

The news impact curve! It shows σ²ₜ as a function of εₜ₋₁. It's a parabola—both positive AND negative shocks increase volatility equally. This is why the basic GARCH is symmetric (unlike EGARCH or GJR-GARCH which capture leverage effects).

Happy to answer questions about the implementation!

Ever wonder why stock market turbulence seems to come in waves?

I just built a model that explains this! It's called GARCH, and it shows that volatility clusters—periods of chaos follow chaos, calm follows calm.

The math is elegant: today's uncertainty depends on yesterday's surprises AND yesterday's uncertainty. With typical parameters, a market shock today still ripples through for months.

**Understanding Market Volatility: A GARCH Model Implementation**

I recently completed a from-scratch implementation of the GARCH(1,1) model—a cornerstone of financial econometrics used in risk management, option pricing, and portfolio optimization.

**Technical Highlights:**

The conditional variance follows: σ²ₜ = ω + αε²ₜ₋₁ + βσ²ₜ₋₁

Key implementation components:
- Monte Carlo simulation of GARCH processes
- Maximum likelihood estimation via L-BFGS-B optimization
- Multi-step volatility forecasting with mean reversion
- Diagnostic testing (Ljung-Box on squared residuals)

**Results:**
- Parameter recovery: Estimated values closely match simulation truth
- Persistence: α+β ≈ 0.95 indicates highly persistent volatility shocks
- The news impact curve demonstrates symmetric response to positive/negative shocks

**Skills demonstrated:** Python, NumPy, SciPy optimization, financial econometrics, statistical modeling, data visualization

This exercise reinforced the importance of understanding models at a foundational level rather than relying solely on library implementations.

The math behind market chaos

This plot shows GARCH in action—a model that explains why volatility clusters.

The bottom-right panel is my favorite: the "news impact curve." It shows how shocks affect future uncertainty.

Notice it's symmetric? Both good and bad surprises increase volatility equally. That's a key insight for risk management.

σ²ₜ = ω + αε²ₜ₋₁ + βσ²ₜ₋₁

Built from scratch in Python.
