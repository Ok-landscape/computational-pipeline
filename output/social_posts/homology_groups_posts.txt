How do you count holes in shapes mathematically?

Homology groups detect "holes" of different dimensions:
- b0 = connected components
- b1 = loops
- b2 = voids

A torus has b1=2 (two independent loops!)

Homology groups: the mathematical machinery for detecting "holes" in topological spaces.

Betti numbers count:
- b0: connected pieces
- b1: 1D holes (loops)
- b2: 2D holes (cavities)

The torus has b0=1, b1=2, b2=1 - explaining why it's fundamentally different from a sphere.

Ever wonder how mathematicians rigorously define "holes" in shapes?

Homology groups are the answer! They're algebraic invariants that capture topological structure.

The key insight: build a "chain complex" of simplices, then quotient cycles by boundaries.

What falls out:
- Circle: one loop (b1=1)
- Sphere: one cavity (b2=1)
- Torus: two loops + one cavity

The Euler characteristic X = b0 - b1 + b2 connects this to classical geometry.

Built a Python implementation from scratch!

Implemented homology group computation in Python using boundary matrices and rank calculations.

The chain complex C_n --> C_{n-1} --> ... satisfies the key property: the boundary of a boundary is zero (d^2 = 0).

Homology H_n = ker(d_n) / im(d_{n+1}) captures n-dimensional holes.

Results verified:
- S^1: H_0=Z, H_1=Z
- S^2: H_0=Z, H_1=0, H_2=Z
- T^2: H_0=Z, H_1=Z^2, H_2=Z

Euler-Poincare formula confirmed: X from simplices = X from Betti numbers.

Title: I built a Python implementation of homology group computation from scratch

Body:

**TL;DR:** Homology groups detect "holes" in shapes. I wrote Python code to compute them using boundary matrices.

**What are homology groups?**

Imagine you want to mathematically distinguish a coffee mug from a ball. They're both smooth surfaces, but the mug has a handle - a "hole" you can stick your finger through. Homology groups formalize this intuition.

The Betti numbers tell you:
- b0 = number of connected pieces
- b1 = number of 1D holes (loops)
- b2 = number of 2D holes (cavities)

**How it works:**

1. Represent your space as a simplicial complex (vertices, edges, triangles, etc.)
2. Build boundary matrices that encode how n-simplices connect to (n-1)-simplices
3. The key property: the boundary of a boundary is always zero
4. Homology = cycles that aren't boundaries

**What I learned:**

- A hollow triangle (circle) has b1=1 - one loop
- A filled triangle (disk) has b1=0 - the triangle "fills" the hole
- A hollow tetrahedron (sphere) has b2=1 - one cavity
- A torus has b1=2 - two independent loops (meridian and longitude)

The Euler characteristic X = b0 - b1 + b2 + ... works out to 2 for a sphere and 0 for a torus.

How do mathematicians count "holes" in shapes?

Homology groups are the answer - they're algebraic tools that detect topological features.

A coffee mug and a donut are "the same" topologically (both have one hole). But a ball has no holes. Homology makes this precise!

I built a Python implementation that computes these groups automatically. The code verified that a torus has two independent loops while a sphere has none.

Math is beautiful when you can compute it.

Exploring Computational Algebraic Topology: Homology Groups in Python

I recently completed a project implementing homology group computation from first principles - a fascinating intersection of abstract mathematics and practical programming.

**The Problem:** How do we rigorously detect and classify "holes" in topological spaces?

**The Solution:** Homology groups provide algebraic invariants that capture the essential structure of a space. The Betti numbers (b0, b1, b2, ...) count holes of each dimension.

**Technical Approach:**
- Represented spaces as simplicial complexes
- Constructed boundary matrices mapping n-chains to (n-1)-chains
- Applied rank-nullity theorem to compute homology dimensions
- Verified results against known topological invariants

**Key Results:**
- Circle: b1=1 (one loop)
- Sphere: b2=1 (one cavity)
- Torus: b1=2, b2=1 (two loops, one cavity)

This work demonstrates how abstract mathematical concepts become computationally tractable through careful algorithm design.

Counting holes with math

Homology groups are how topologists detect "holes" in shapes.

The Betti numbers tell the story:
b0 = connected pieces
b1 = loops you can draw
b2 = cavities inside

A donut (torus) has:
b0 = 1 (one piece)
b1 = 2 (two loops!)
b2 = 1 (hollow inside)

Built this visualization showing different spaces and their homology.

The Euler characteristic X = b0 - b1 + b2 is 0 for a torus but 2 for a sphere.

Math reveals what eyes can't always see.
