How do you find eigenvalues of a 10,000×10,000 matrix without computing all of them?

The Lanczos algorithm turns it into a tiny tridiagonal problem using Krylov subspaces.

Extremal eigenvalues converge first!

The Lanczos algorithm: a 1950s breakthrough still powering modern computation.

It finds eigenvalues of huge sparse matrices by projecting onto Krylov subspaces, producing a tridiagonal matrix Tₘ = VₘᵀAVₘ.

The extremal eigenvalues (largest & smallest) converge fastest—perfect for most applications.

## 3. Threads (< 500 chars)

Ever wonder how scientists compute eigenvalues of matrices with millions of entries?

The Lanczos algorithm (1950) is the answer. It works by building a Krylov subspace:

span{v₁, Av₁, A²v₁, ..., Aᵐ⁻¹v₁}

The magic: for symmetric matrices, this projects onto a tridiagonal matrix—super easy to solve!

Three-term recurrence:
β_{j+1}v_{j+1} = Avⱼ - αⱼvⱼ - βⱼv_{j-1}

Used in quantum chemistry, PCA, and network analysis. Still indispensable after 70+ years.

## 4. Mastodon (< 500 chars)

Implemented the Lanczos algorithm for eigenvalue computation of large symmetric matrices.

Key insight: Project A onto Krylov subspace K_m(A,v₁) to get tridiagonal matrix T_m.

The Ritz values (eigenvalues of T_m) approximate A's eigenvalues, with extremal ones converging first at rate related to Chebyshev polynomials.

Tested on 100×100 discrete Laplacian—50 iterations give <10⁻¹⁰ error for extremal eigenvalues.

Full reorthogonalization maintains numerical stability.

**Title:** Implemented the Lanczos Algorithm in Python - Here's How It Finds Eigenvalues of Huge Matrices

**Body:**

**The Problem:** You have a massive symmetric matrix (think 10,000×10,000) and need its eigenvalues. Computing all of them is way too slow.

**The Solution:** The Lanczos algorithm (1950) cleverly reduces this to a much smaller problem.

**How it works (ELI5):**

1. Start with a random vector v₁
2. Build the Krylov subspace: {v₁, Av₁, A²v₁, ...}
3. For symmetric matrices, this creates a tridiagonal matrix T_m (mostly zeros!)
4. The eigenvalues of tiny T_m approximate the eigenvalues of massive A

**The cool part:** Extremal eigenvalues (largest and smallest) converge first! After just 50 iterations on a 100×100 matrix, I got errors below 10⁻¹⁰ for the extreme eigenvalues.

**Three-term recurrence** makes it efficient:
- β_{j+1}·v_{j+1} = A·vⱼ - αⱼ·vⱼ - βⱼ·v_{j-1}
- α values form the diagonal
- β values form the off-diagonals

**Real-world uses:**
- Quantum chemistry calculations
- PCA/spectral clustering in ML
- Vibration analysis in engineering
- Network/graph analysis

How do computers find patterns in massive datasets?

Often they need eigenvalues of huge matrices—but computing them all would take forever.

The Lanczos algorithm (invented in 1950!) solves this elegantly. It builds a special subspace where the problem becomes tiny but still accurate.

The largest and smallest eigenvalues pop out first—usually exactly what scientists need!

Used in everything from chemistry simulations to machine learning.

**Implementing Classical Algorithms: The Lanczos Method for Large-Scale Eigenvalue Problems**

In computational science, we often encounter symmetric matrices far too large for direct eigenvalue computation. The Lanczos algorithm, developed by Cornelius Lanczos in 1950, remains the go-to solution.

**Technical Approach:**
The algorithm projects matrix A onto a Krylov subspace K_m(A,v₁) = span{v₁, Av₁, A²v₁, ..., Aᵐ⁻¹v₁}, yielding a tridiagonal matrix T_m whose eigenvalues (Ritz values) approximate those of A.

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Three-term recurrence: β_{j+1}v_{j+1} = Avⱼ - αⱼvⱼ - βⱼv_{j-1}
- Full reorthogonalization for numerical stability
- Convergence driven by Chebyshev polynomial bounds

**Results:**
Testing on a 100×100 discrete Laplacian, 50 iterations achieved <10⁻¹⁰ error for extremal eigenvalues—demonstrating the algorithm's rapid convergence where it matters most.

**Applications:** Quantum chemistry, structural mechanics, spectral clustering, network analysis.

The Lanczos Algorithm: 70 years old and still essential ✨

This visualization shows how eigenvalue approximations converge—extremal values (red & blue lines) drop to machine precision in just tens of iterations.

How it works:
→ Build Krylov subspace from matrix-vector products
→ Project to tridiagonal form
→ Solve the tiny problem instead

Used in:
• Quantum simulations
• Machine learning (PCA)
• Network analysis
• Engineering vibration studies

Sometimes the classics are classics for a reason.
