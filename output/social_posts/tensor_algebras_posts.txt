Tensors: not just matrices with more dimensions. They're multilinear maps that transform predictably under basis changes.

Built a Python notebook exploring tensor products, contractions & invariants.

Tensor algebras are fundamental to physics and ML alike. Today's notebook explores:

- Tensor products (u ⊗ v)
- Einstein summation via np.einsum
- Metric tensors for index raising/lowering
- Invariants like trace under similarity transforms

All implemented in NumPy with visualizations.

What's a tensor? Not just "a matrix with more indices."

A tensor is a multilinear map that transforms in a specific way under basis changes. That transformation law is what makes tensors so powerful in physics.

Today I built a Python notebook covering:
- Tensor products and their bilinearity
- Contraction (generalizes the trace)
- Metric tensors (how geometry enters)
- The Levi-Civita symbol (totally antisymmetric!)

Dimension grows as d^k for rank-k tensors. That's why tensor networks matter for efficiency.

New computational notebook: Tensor Algebras

Covered the fundamentals:
- Tensor product T(V) = F ⊕ V ⊕ (V⊗V) ⊕ ...
- Einstein summation: np.einsum('ij,j->i', A, v)
- Index contraction reducing rank: T^{ij}_{jk} → T^i_k
- Metric tensor g_ij for raising/lowering indices
- Levi-Civita symbol ε_ijk for cross products

Key insight: trace and determinant are similarity invariants—they don't change under basis transformations. The visualization shows this beautifully.

**Title:** I built a computational notebook exploring tensor algebras with NumPy - here's what I learned

**Body:**

If you've ever wondered what tensors really are beyond "multidimensional arrays," this might help.

**What's a tensor?**

A tensor of type (r, s) is a multilinear map. Think of it this way:
- Scalars are rank-0 tensors
- Vectors are rank-1 tensors
- Matrices are rank-2 tensors
- And it keeps going...

The key property is how they *transform* under basis changes. A tensor's components follow specific transformation laws involving the change-of-basis matrix and its inverse.

**What I implemented:**

1. **Tensor products** using `np.tensordot` - verified bilinearity properties
2. **Contraction** with `np.einsum` - the generalization of matrix trace
3. **Transformation laws** - showing how vectors/tensors change under rotation
4. **Metric tensors** - how to raise/lower indices, fundamental for geometry
5. **Symmetric/antisymmetric decomposition** - every tensor splits into these parts
6. **Levi-Civita symbol** - computed cross products using ε_ijk

**Cool visualization:**

The plot shows how different metric tensors turn the "unit circle" into ellipses. The Euclidean metric gives you the standard circle, but oblique coordinates stretch it. Also verified that trace and determinant are true invariants under similarity transforms.

**Why it matters:**

- General relativity uses the Riemann curvature tensor R^μ_νρσ
- Machine learning uses tensor decompositions (CP, Tucker)
- Quantum states of multiple particles live in tensor product spaces

Happy to answer questions about the implementation!

Ever wonder what tensors actually are?

They're not just "arrays with more dimensions" - they're mathematical objects that transform in a specific, predictable way when you change your coordinate system.

I built an interactive Python notebook exploring tensor algebras: tensor products, contractions, metric tensors, and invariants.

The visualization shows how different metrics stretch the unit circle into ellipses - that's geometry emerging from algebra!

Tensor Algebras: From Mathematical Foundations to NumPy Implementation

I recently completed a computational notebook exploring tensor algebras—a fundamental mathematical structure underpinning general relativity, continuum mechanics, and modern machine learning.

Key concepts implemented:

• Tensor Products: Bilinear operations creating higher-rank objects. Dimension scales as d^k for rank-k tensors over d-dimensional spaces.

• Einstein Summation: Leveraged np.einsum for elegant index notation matching mathematical conventions.

• Transformation Laws: Demonstrated how tensor components transform under basis changes, preserving geometric meaning.

• Metric Tensors: Implemented index raising/lowering operations essential for Riemannian geometry.

• Invariants: Verified computationally that trace and determinant remain unchanged under similarity transformations.

The visualization component illustrates how different metric tensors deform unit circles into characteristic ellipses—a direct geometric interpretation of the abstract algebra.

Skills demonstrated: NumPy, scientific computing, mathematical modeling, data visualization.

Tensor Algebras in Python

These plots show the beautiful structure of tensor mathematics:

Top left: Dimension explodes as tensor rank increases (d^k growth)

Top right: A slice through a rank-3 tensor

Bottom left: How different metrics stretch the unit circle into ellipses

Bottom right: Trace and determinant are true invariants—they survive any basis change

Tensors aren't just matrices with more indices. They're objects with transformation laws that make physics possible.
