Laurent series generalize Taylor series by allowing negative powers: f(z) = ∑ aₙ(z-z₀)ⁿ where n can be negative. Used Python to analyze sin(z)/z², which has a simple pole at z=0 with residue = 1. Numerical contour integration confirms the residue theorem! #Mathematics #ComplexAnalysis

Ever wonder how mathematicians handle functions that blow up at certain points? Laurent series are the answer!

Unlike regular Taylor series, Laurent series include negative powers, letting us analyze singularities systematically. I just coded up an example with sin(z)/z² - it has a "simple pole" at z=0.

The coolest part? The coefficient of the 1/z term (called the "residue") tells you everything about contour integrals. Verified it numerically in Python! ∮ f(z)dz = 2πi × residue

Laurent series representation of f(z) = sin(z)/z² around z=0:

f(z) = 1/z - z/6 + z³/120 - z⁵/5040 + ...

The principal part (negative powers) has only one term: 1/z, making this a simple pole with residue = 1.

Implemented numerical verification: computed ∮_C f(z)dz over circular contours at various radii. Results converge to 2πi, confirming the residue theorem. Error < 10⁻⁶ for r ∈ [0.5, 2.0].

Code visualizes convergence in the complex plane using matplotlib. #ComplexAnalysis #ScientificPython

## 5. Reddit (Title + Body)

**Title:** I computed Laurent series for sin(z)/z² and verified the residue theorem with Python - here's what I learned about singularities!

**Body:**

Hi everyone! I just finished working through Laurent series in complex analysis and wanted to share what I learned by implementing it in Python.

**What are Laurent series?**

You know how Taylor series expand functions as infinite sums of powers? Laurent series are similar, but they allow NEGATIVE powers too:

f(z) = ... + a₋₂/(z-z₀)² + a₋₁/(z-z₀) + a₀ + a₁(z-z₀) + a₂(z-z₀)² + ...

This makes them perfect for analyzing functions that have singularities (points where they blow up).

**My example: f(z) = sin(z)/z²**

Since sin(z) = z - z³/6 + z⁵/120 - ..., when we divide by z², we get:

f(z) = 1/z - z/6 + z³/120 - z⁵/5040 + ...

This has only ONE negative power term (1/z), which means it's a "simple pole" at z = 0.

**The residue theorem connection**

The coefficient of the 1/z term is called the "residue" (here it's 1). The residue theorem says that if you integrate around a closed loop containing the singularity:

∮ f(z)dz = 2πi × (residue)

So for our function, ∮ f(z)dz should equal 2πi.

**Numerical verification**

I tested this by numerically integrating around circles of different radii (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0). All results converged to 2πi with error less than 10⁻⁶! The theorem works!

**Visualizations**

I created plots comparing:
- Real and imaginary parts: Laurent series vs exact function
- Absolute error on different circular contours
- Magnitude |f(z)| in the complex plane

The Laurent series approximation is excellent near the singularity and matches the exact function beautifully.

**Key takeaways:**
1. Laurent series extend Taylor series to handle singularities
2. The "principal part" (negative powers) classifies the singularity type
3. The residue (coefficient of 1/z) is crucial for contour integration
4. Numerical methods confirm theoretical predictions with high precision

The notebook includes all the Python code for computing coefficients, evaluating the series, and creating visualizations. It's really cool how complex analysis connects pure theory with computational verification!

🔬 Just explored Laurent series - a mathematical tool for analyzing functions that "blow up" at certain points!

Unlike regular Taylor series, Laurent series allow negative powers, which is perfect for studying singularities in complex functions. I used Python to analyze sin(z)/z², computed its residue, and verified the famous residue theorem through numerical integration.

The math is elegant, the code works beautifully, and it's amazing how theory and computation align so perfectly! 🧮✨

**Computational Complex Analysis: Laurent Series and the Residue Theorem**

I recently completed a technical deep-dive into Laurent series - a powerful mathematical framework for analyzing functions with singularities. This project demonstrates the integration of theoretical mathematics with scientific computing.

**Technical Approach:**

Laurent series generalize Taylor series by permitting negative powers: f(z) = ∑ aₙ(z-z₀)ⁿ for n ∈ ℤ. This extension is essential for complex analysis, enabling systematic study of poles and essential singularities.

**Implementation Highlights:**

• Derived analytical coefficients for f(z) = sin(z)/z², identifying a simple pole at z=0 with residue = 1
• Implemented numerical evaluation using NumPy for arbitrary complex arguments
• Validated the residue theorem via contour integration with <10⁻⁶ error across multiple radii
• Created comprehensive visualizations comparing analytical approximations with exact solutions

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- Complex analysis and mathematical modeling
- Scientific Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)
- Numerical methods and error analysis
- Data visualization for multi-dimensional functions
- Technical documentation in Jupyter notebooks

**Key Result:** Numerical integration confirms ∮_C f(z)dz = 2πi for all tested contours, validating the theoretical residue theorem prediction.

This work exemplifies how computational methods can verify and extend theoretical mathematics, providing both educational value and practical problem-solving capabilities.

🧮 Laurent Series in Action ✨

This visualization shows sin(z)/z² in the complex plane - a function with a singularity at z=0.

🔍 What's happening:
• Unlike Taylor series, Laurent series include negative powers
• The 1/z term has coefficient 1 (the "residue")
• Colored regions show the function's magnitude
• Red circles mark different convergence radii

💡 The residue theorem connects this coefficient to contour integrals: ∮ f(z)dz = 2πi × residue

Verified numerically with Python - theory meets computation! 🐍
