Light is just E and B fields dancing in sync at 3×10⁸ m/s!

Visualized Maxwell's equations: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t shows how oscillating fields create waves that carry energy through the Poynting vector S = (1/μ₀)E×B

Electromagnetic waves explained through code: E and B fields oscillate in phase, perpendicular to each other, traveling at c = 1/√(μ₀ε₀) ≈ 3×10⁸ m/s.

The Poynting vector S = (1/μ₀)E×B shows energy flowing in the propagation direction. Beautiful physics made visual with Python.

Ever wonder why light travels at exactly 299,792,458 m/s?

Maxwell figured it out: c = 1/√(μ₀ε₀)

The speed of light comes from two fundamental constants - the permittivity and permeability of free space!

Built a Python simulation showing how E and B fields oscillate together, always perpendicular, carrying energy through space via the Poynting vector.

The math is gorgeous: ∇²E = μ₀ε₀(∂²E/∂t²)

This wave equation describes everything from radio waves to gamma rays!

Implemented a visualization of electromagnetic wave propagation from Maxwell's equations.

Key insights from the simulation:
- E and B fields oscillate in phase with ratio E₀/B₀ = c
- Energy flux given by Poynting vector: ⟨S⟩ = ½ε₀cE₀²
- Wave equation: ∇²E = μ₀ε₀(∂²E/∂t²)
- Speed emerges as c = 1/√(μ₀ε₀)

For 500nm light (green): f ≈ 6×10¹⁴ Hz

The equal partition of energy between E and B fields (u_E = u_B) is a beautiful result.

**Title:** Visualizing Electromagnetic Waves with Python - From Maxwell's Equations to the Poynting Vector

**Body:**

I created a Jupyter notebook that visualizes electromagnetic wave propagation, and wanted to share some insights!

**The Physics:**

Maxwell's equations in free space lead to the wave equation:

∇²E = μ₀ε₀(∂²E/∂t²)

This tells us electromagnetic waves travel at c = 1/√(μ₀ε₀) ≈ 3×10⁸ m/s - the speed of light emerges naturally from the permittivity and permeability of free space!

**Key Findings:**

1. E and B fields oscillate **in phase** - they reach maxima/minima simultaneously
2. The fields are mutually perpendicular (E ⊥ B ⊥ k)
3. The amplitude ratio E₀/B₀ = c always
4. Energy is equally distributed: u_E = u_B = ½ε₀E₀²

**The Poynting Vector:**

Energy flow is described by S = (1/μ₀)E×B

The time-averaged intensity works out to ⟨S⟩ = ½ε₀cE₀²

**What I Learned:**

The simulation really drove home how the same mathematical framework describes everything from radio waves (λ > 1m) to gamma rays (λ < 0.01nm). Only the wavelength/frequency changes - the fundamental physics is identical.

**View the notebook:** https://cocalc.com/github/Ok-landscape/computational-pipeline/blob/main/notebooks/published/electromagnetic_waves.ipynb

The notebook includes 3D visualization of the perpendicular E and B fields, time evolution plots, and energy flux analysis. All code is self-contained with numpy and matplotlib.

Did you know the speed of light isn't arbitrary? It comes from two fundamental constants of the universe!

c = 1/√(μ₀ε₀) ≈ 300,000 km/s

I visualized how light actually works - electric and magnetic fields dancing perpendicular to each other, carrying energy through empty space.

The same math describes radio waves, visible light, and X-rays. Just different wavelengths!

**Visualizing Electromagnetic Wave Physics with Python**

I developed a computational notebook demonstrating electromagnetic wave propagation derived from Maxwell's equations.

**Technical Highlights:**

• Derived the wave equation ∇²E = μ₀ε₀(∂²E/∂t²) showing wave speed c = 1/√(μ₀ε₀)

• Implemented plane wave solutions: E_x = E₀cos(kz - ωt) with corresponding B field

• Calculated energy transport via Poynting vector S = (1/μ₀)E×B

• Verified equal energy partition between electric and magnetic field components

**Key Results:**

For 500nm visible light: frequency ≈ 6×10¹⁴ Hz, demonstrating the dispersion relation ω = ck

The simulation confirms E₀/B₀ = c and visualizes the mutual orthogonality of E, B, and propagation direction.

**Skills Demonstrated:** Scientific computing, physics simulation, data visualization, mathematical modeling

**Tools:** Python, NumPy, Matplotlib (3D plotting)

Light is electromagnetic poetry ✨

These plots show how electric (blue) and magnetic (red) fields oscillate together, perpendicular to each other, traveling at 300,000 km/s

The speed of light comes from:
c = 1/√(μ₀ε₀)

Two constants of empty space determine how fast light travels!

The purple graph shows energy flow - the Poynting vector peaks when both fields are strongest

Same math works for:
📻 Radio waves
🌈 Visible light
☢️ X-rays

Only the wavelength changes!
