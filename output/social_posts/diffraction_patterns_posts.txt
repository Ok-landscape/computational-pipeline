Ever wonder why microscopes have resolution limits? It's all about diffraction!

When light passes through an aperture, it spreads out in predictable patterns. I simulated three classic cases:

• Single-slit: I = I₀(sin β/β)²
• Double-slit: adds cos²γ interference fringes
• Circular aperture: creates the famous Airy disk

The Airy disk radius (θ ≈ 1.22λ/D) is why telescopes need bigger mirrors to see finer details. Physics is beautiful!

Simulated Fraunhofer diffraction patterns in Python using NumPy and SciPy's Bessel functions.

Key equations implemented:
• Single-slit: I(θ) = I₀(sin β/β)² where β = πa·sin θ/λ
• Double-slit: multiplied by cos²(πd·sin θ/λ) for interference
• Circular aperture: I(θ) = I₀(2J₁(ka·sin θ)/(ka·sin θ))²

The Rayleigh criterion (first Airy minimum at θ ≈ 1.22λ/D) defines fundamental resolution limits in microscopy and astronomy.

**Title:** Simulating Diffraction Patterns in Python: Single-Slit, Double-Slit, and Airy Disk

**Body:**

I created a computational notebook exploring three fundamental diffraction phenomena that demonstrate the wave nature of light.

**What I simulated:**

1. **Single-slit diffraction** - When light passes through a narrow slit, it spreads out. The intensity follows I = I₀(sin β/β)² where β = πa·sin θ/λ. Narrower slits → wider patterns.

2. **Double-slit diffraction** - Young's famous experiment! The pattern combines interference (cos² term from two sources) with the single-slit envelope. The ratio d/a tells you how many bright fringes fit in the central maximum.

3. **Circular aperture (Airy pattern)** - This one uses Bessel functions! The resulting concentric rings define resolution limits. The first dark ring appears at θ ≈ 1.22λ/D (Rayleigh criterion).

**Why it matters:**
- Microscope resolution limits
- Telescope mirror sizing
- Spectroscopy with diffraction gratings
- Holography fundamentals

**Parameters used:**
- λ = 632.8 nm (He-Ne laser)
- Slit width: 50 μm
- Slit separation: 250 μm
- Aperture diameter: 100 μm

The code is self-contained using NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.

Why can't microscopes see atoms, and why do telescopes need huge mirrors?

The answer is diffraction - light bending around edges!

I simulated how light creates beautiful patterns when passing through slits and circular openings. The "Airy disk" pattern from circular apertures sets a fundamental limit on what any optical instrument can resolve.

This is why the James Webb Space Telescope has a 6.5m mirror - bigger aperture = finer details!

**Computational Physics: Simulating Optical Diffraction Patterns**

I developed a Python-based simulation exploring fundamental wave optics phenomena: single-slit, double-slit, and circular aperture (Airy) diffraction patterns.

**Technical Implementation:**
• Fraunhofer diffraction calculations using NumPy
• Bessel function evaluation via SciPy for Airy patterns
• Comprehensive 1D and 2D visualizations with Matplotlib

**Key Concepts Demonstrated:**
• Single-slit intensity: I(θ) = I₀(sin β/β)²
• Double-slit interference modulation
• Rayleigh resolution criterion: θ ≈ 1.22λ/D

**Practical Applications:**
These patterns are foundational to optical system design, including microscopy resolution limits, telescope aperture sizing, spectroscopic instrumentation, and holographic systems.

**Skills Applied:** Scientific computing, numerical methods, physics simulation, data visualization, technical documentation.

The self-contained notebook demonstrates the intersection of physics theory and computational implementation.

The beautiful mathematics of light ✨

These aren't abstract art - they're diffraction patterns! When light squeezes through tiny openings, it spreads and creates these intricate intensity distributions.

The circular "Airy disk" pattern (bottom right) is why every telescope and microscope has a resolution limit. Bigger apertures = sharper images.

Simulated with:
• λ = 632.8 nm laser light
• 50-100 μm apertures
• Python + NumPy + SciPy

Physics: where math becomes visible.
