Ever wonder how quants track hedge ratios that change over time?

Kalman Filters aren't just for rockets — they're essential in quantitative finance.

Applied one to estimate time-varying hedge ratios between cointegrated assets. The result: 48% lower MSE than rolling OLS.

The filter adapts to regime changes far faster than fixed-window methods.

Just built a Kalman Filter for pairs trading and the results are impressive.

The concept: asset relationships aren't static. A hedge ratio β that works today might be wrong tomorrow due to market shifts.

The Kalman Filter models β as evolving over time:
- Predict: β̂ₜ = β̂ₜ₋₁
- Update: β̂ₜ = β̂ₜ + K(yₜ - β̂ₜxₜ)

Where K is the "Kalman gain" that optimally weights new info vs prior estimates.

My test: 48% lower error than 60-day rolling regression. The filter catches regime changes almost instantly.

Implemented a Kalman Filter for dynamic hedge ratio estimation in Python.

State-space model:
- State: βₜ = βₜ₋₁ + ηₜ (random walk)
- Observation: yₜ = βₜxₜ + εₜ

The recursive update:
1. Predict: P̂ₜ|ₜ₋₁ = Pₜ₋₁ + Q
2. Kalman Gain: Kₜ = P̂ₜHₜᵀ(HₜP̂ₜHₜᵀ + R)⁻¹
3. Update: β̂ₜ = β̂ₜ|ₜ₋₁ + Kₜ(zₜ - Hₜβ̂ₜ|ₜ₋₁)

Result: 48% MSE improvement over rolling OLS. The filter also provides uncertainty estimates via the state covariance matrix.

**Title:** Built a Kalman Filter for Dynamic Hedge Ratios in Pairs Trading — 48% Better Than Rolling OLS

**Body:**

**The Problem**

In pairs trading, you need to know the hedge ratio β between two cointegrated assets: y = βx + error. But here's the catch — β isn't constant! Market conditions change, correlations shift, and what worked last month might be wrong today.

**The Traditional Approach**

Most people use rolling OLS with a fixed window (say, 60 days). Problem: it lags behind regime changes because you're averaging stale data.

**The Kalman Filter Solution**

Instead of treating β as fixed, model it as a hidden state that evolves over time:

- State equation: βₜ = βₜ₋₁ + noise (β follows a random walk)
- Observation: yₜ = βₜxₜ + noise (we observe prices with noise)

The Kalman Filter recursively updates your β estimate as each new price arrives:

1. **Predict**: Use yesterday's β as today's prior estimate
2. **Update**: Combine prior with new observation, weighted by "Kalman gain"

The Kalman gain automatically balances how much you trust the new data vs your prior — more uncertainty in your prior = more weight on new data.

**Results**

On synthetic data with regime changes:
- Static OLS: MSE = 0.02+
- Rolling OLS (60-day): MSE = 0.0037
- Kalman Filter: MSE = 0.0019

That's a **48% improvement** over rolling OLS.

**The Code**

The core is surprisingly simple (~50 lines). Key parameters:
- δ (delta): Process noise — how quickly can β change?
- Vₑ: Measurement noise — how noisy are observations?

**What I Learned**

1. The Kalman Filter is the optimal linear estimator (minimum variance)
2. It naturally provides confidence intervals via the covariance matrix
3. It adapts to regime changes almost instantly — no lag from averaging

Just coded a Kalman Filter for finance — the same algorithm that guided Apollo missions to the moon!

In finance, it tracks "hidden" variables like the relationship between two stocks that changes over time.

My result: 48% more accurate than traditional methods at catching when market relationships shift.

The cool part? It automatically knows when to trust new data vs stick with its prior estimate.

Implemented a Kalman Filter for Dynamic Hedge Ratio Estimation

In quantitative finance, the relationship between cointegrated assets evolves over time. Traditional approaches using static or rolling regression fail to adapt quickly to regime changes.

I applied the Kalman Filter — a recursive Bayesian estimator — to track time-varying hedge ratios in a pairs trading context.

Key Technical Approach:
- State-space formulation with β modeled as a random walk
- Recursive predict-update cycle with optimal Kalman gain
- Automatic uncertainty quantification via state covariance

Results:
- 48% lower MSE compared to 60-period rolling OLS
- Near-instantaneous adaptation to regime changes
- Built-in confidence intervals for risk management

Skills Demonstrated:
- State-space modeling
- Bayesian estimation
- Python (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Quantitative finance methodology
