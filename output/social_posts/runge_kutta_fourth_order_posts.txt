Just built a Runge-Kutta solver from scratch! RK4 is one of the most elegant algorithms in numerical analysis.

The idea: Instead of using one slope estimate, compute four slopes (k₁, k₂, k₃, k₄) at different points in your time step, then combine them using Simpson's rule.

Result? Fourth-order accuracy - meaning halving your step size reduces error by a factor of 16!

Tested it on radioactive decay and harmonic oscillators. The phase portrait came out beautifully.

Implemented the classic RK4 method for solving ODEs.

The update formula: y_{n+1} = yₙ + (h/6)(k₁ + 2k₂ + 2k₃ + k₄)

Key results:
• Exponential decay (dy/dt = -λy): Max error ~10⁻⁶
• Harmonic oscillator: Phase portrait nearly indistinguishable from exact solution
• Convergence rate: 4.00 (confirmed O(h⁴) accuracy)
• Energy drift in oscillator: < 0.001%

RK4 remains the default choice for non-stiff problems due to its excellent accuracy-to-cost ratio.

**Title:** Implemented Runge-Kutta 4th Order from Scratch - Here's What I Learned About ODE Solvers

**Body:**

I built a Runge-Kutta Fourth Order (RK4) solver to understand how numerical ODE integration really works, and wanted to share some insights.

**What is RK4?**

When you have a differential equation dy/dt = f(t, y) and want to find y(t), you need to integrate. RK4 does this by computing four slope estimates per step:

- k₁ = f(t, y) — slope at start
- k₂ = f(t + h/2, y + h·k₁/2) — slope at midpoint using k₁
- k₃ = f(t + h/2, y + h·k₂/2) — slope at midpoint using k₂
- k₄ = f(t + h, y + h·k₃) — slope at end using k₃

Then combine: y_{new} = y + (h/6)(k₁ + 2k₂ + 2k₃ + k₄)

**Why the weird weighting?**

The (1, 2, 2, 1)/6 weighting follows Simpson's rule for integration. It's not arbitrary - it's derived from Taylor series matching to achieve fourth-order accuracy.

**Test Results**

1. **Exponential decay** (dy/dt = -0.5y): Max error ~10⁻⁶ with h=0.5
2. **Harmonic oscillator**: Converted the 2nd-order ODE to a system. Phase portrait was nearly perfect.
3. **Convergence test**: Confirmed slope of 4.0 on log-log error plot

**Key Takeaway**

Halving your step size reduces error by 16x (2⁴). That's the power of fourth-order methods!

Ever wondered how computers predict the weather or simulate planetary orbits? They solve differential equations using numerical methods like Runge-Kutta!

I implemented the RK4 algorithm - it's surprisingly elegant. By cleverly sampling slopes at 4 points per step, it achieves incredible accuracy while staying efficient.

Tested it on radioactive decay and pendulum motion. The results matched theory almost perfectly!

**Numerical Methods in Practice: Implementing the Runge-Kutta Fourth Order Method**

As part of my computational research work, I implemented and validated the classic RK4 algorithm for solving ordinary differential equations.

**Technical Highlights:**

• Built modular Python functions for single-step and full integration
• Validated on exponential decay (analytical solution: y = y₀e^{-λt}) with errors < 10⁻⁶
• Tested harmonic oscillator system, converting 2nd-order ODE to coupled 1st-order system
• Performed convergence analysis confirming O(h⁴) accuracy (measured slope: 4.00)
• Analyzed energy conservation - drift remained below 0.001%

**Why RK4 Matters:**

Despite being developed in 1901, RK4 remains the default choice for many applications due to its optimal balance of accuracy (4 function evaluations for 4th-order accuracy) and stability for non-stiff problems.

**Skills Demonstrated:** Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, numerical analysis, scientific visualization, algorithm implementation from mathematical foundations.

The art of numerical integration ✨

This phase portrait shows a harmonic oscillator solved using the Runge-Kutta method.

The ellipse? That's the system tracing through position-velocity space over time.

RK4 computes 4 slope estimates per step:
• k₁ at start
• k₂, k₃ at midpoint
• k₄ at end

Result: 4th-order accuracy.
Halving the step size → 16x less error.

Used in weather prediction, orbital mechanics, game physics, and more.

Built with Python, NumPy & Matplotlib.
