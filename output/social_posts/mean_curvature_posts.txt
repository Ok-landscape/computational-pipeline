Mean curvature H = (κ₁ + κ₂)/2 tells us how surfaces bend in 3D space.

Sphere: constant H = 1/R
Torus: variable H across surface
Saddle: H passes through zero

When H = 0 everywhere? That's a minimal surface (like soap films!)

Exploring mean curvature in differential geometry: the average of principal curvatures at each point on a surface.

Computed H for sphere (constant 1/R), torus (varying by position), and hyperbolic paraboloid (saddle).

Minimal surfaces have H = 0—nature's area-minimizing shapes.

Ever wonder how mathematicians describe the "bendiness" of a surface?

Mean curvature H = (κ₁ + κ₂)/2 averages the max and min ways a surface curves at each point.

Some cool results:
- Spheres have constant curvature H = 1/R
- Tori (donut shapes) curve more on the outside than inside
- Saddle surfaces can have H = 0 at certain points

When H = 0 everywhere, you get a minimal surface—like soap films stretched across wire frames!

Built this visualization with Python + NumPy.

Implemented mean curvature computation using the fundamental forms from differential geometry.

Formula: H = (EN - 2FM + GL) / 2(EG - F²)

where E, F, G are first fundamental form coefficients and L, M, N are second fundamental form coefficients.

Verified against analytical solutions:
- Sphere (R=2): H = 0.5 (constant)
- Torus (R=3, r=1): H ∈ [0.125, 0.625]
- Hyperbolic paraboloid: variable, passes through zero

Code computes derivatives numerically and handles surface normals via cross products.

**Title:** [OC] Computing Mean Curvature of 3D Surfaces with Python - Sphere, Torus, and Saddle Visualizations

**Body:**

I built a Python notebook exploring mean curvature—a fundamental concept in differential geometry that describes how surfaces bend in 3D space.

**What is mean curvature?**

At every point on a smooth surface, there are two "principal curvatures" κ₁ and κ₂ representing the maximum and minimum bending. Mean curvature is simply their average:

H = (κ₁ + κ₂) / 2

**Why does it matter?**

- When H = 0 everywhere, you have a "minimal surface" (like soap films!)
- Spheres have constant mean curvature H = 1/R
- Understanding curvature is essential for computer graphics, physics simulations, and geometric analysis

**What I computed:**

1. **Sphere** - Verified that H = 1/R holds numerically
2. **Torus** - Showed how H varies from outer edge (higher) to inner edge (lower)
3. **Hyperbolic paraboloid (saddle)** - Demonstrated variable curvature with some points near H = 0

**The method:**

Used the first and second fundamental forms with the formula:

H = (EN - 2FM + GL) / 2(EG - F²)

This involves computing partial derivatives of the surface parametrization and the unit normal vector.

**Tools:** Python, NumPy, Matplotlib

How do mathematicians measure the "bendiness" of a surface?

Meet mean curvature! It's the average of how much a surface curves in different directions at each point.

Fun facts:
- A sphere curves the same everywhere (H = 1/R)
- A donut (torus) curves more on the outside than inside
- Soap films are "minimal surfaces" where H = 0—nature finds the least-area shape!

I coded this up in Python with some pretty visualizations.

Differential Geometry in Practice: Computing Mean Curvature with Python

Just completed a computational exploration of mean curvature—a fundamental metric in differential geometry with applications in computer graphics, physics simulations, and geometric analysis.

Key Technical Highlights:

The implementation computes mean curvature H = (κ₁ + κ₂)/2 using the classical formula involving first and second fundamental forms:

H = (EN - 2FM + GL) / 2(EG - F²)

This requires computing partial derivatives of surface parametrizations and unit normal vectors via cross products.

Surfaces Analyzed:
- Sphere: Verified constant curvature H = 1/R
- Torus: Demonstrated variable curvature distribution (H ∈ [0.125, 0.625] for R=3, r=1)
- Hyperbolic paraboloid: Visualized saddle geometry with varying curvature

The numerical results matched analytical solutions with high precision, validating the computational approach.

Skills demonstrated: NumPy vectorization, 3D visualization with Matplotlib, mathematical modeling, differential geometry.

The mathematics of bending surfaces

Mean curvature tells us how a surface curves at each point—it's the average of the principal curvatures.

Color code:
Red = curving one way
Blue = curving the other

The sphere has constant curvature everywhere.
The torus varies from outer edge to inner.
The saddle passes through zero—a minimal surface point!

Soap films naturally form minimal surfaces (H = 0) because they minimize area.
