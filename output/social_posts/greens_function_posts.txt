Green's functions: the "unit impulse response" of differential equations. Apply a point source, see how the system responds everywhere.

G(x, x') shows response at x from source at x'

Solution = ∫G(x,x')f(x')dx'

Green's functions transform complex differential equations into elegant integrals. The function G(x, x') captures how a system responds at point x to an impulse at x'.

For Poisson's equation: u(x) = ∫G(x,x')f(x')dx'

Symmetry G(x,x') = G(x',x) reflects reciprocity in physics.

Ever wonder how physicists solve complex equations for heat flow, electrostatics, or quantum mechanics?

Green's functions are the answer! They represent how a system responds to a single point source.

The magic: once you know G(x, x'), ANY source f(x) can be solved by integration:
u(x) = ∫G(x,x')f(x')dx'

Think of it like this - if you know how one domino falls, you can predict how any pattern of dominoes will fall.

Built a Python implementation that matches analytical solutions with error < 10⁻¹⁵!

Implemented Green's functions for the 1D Poisson equation in Python.

For operator L with LG(x,x') = δ(x-x'), solutions to Lu = f become:
u(x) = ∫G(x,x')f(x')dx'

Key properties:
- Symmetry: G(x,x') = G(x',x) for self-adjoint operators
- Singularity at source point
- Spectral form: G = Σφₙ(x)φₙ*(x')/λₙ

Also visualized the heat kernel - Gaussian spreading with normalization preserved.

Numerical vs analytical error: O(10⁻¹⁵)

**Title:** Green's Functions Explained: How Physicists Solve Differential Equations with "Impulse Responses"

**Body:**

**What are Green's functions?**

Imagine you have a complex system - heat flowing through a rod, electric potential from charges, quantum particles moving through space. These are all described by differential equations that can be hard to solve directly.

Green's functions provide a clever shortcut: instead of solving for arbitrary sources, first solve for a single point source (a delta function δ). This gives you G(x, x'), which tells you the response at position x when you poke the system at position x'.

**Why is this useful?**

Once you know G, you can solve for ANY source distribution f(x) using superposition:

u(x) = ∫G(x, x')f(x')dx'

It's like knowing how one drop creates ripples in a pond - then you can predict the pattern from any arrangement of drops!

**What I implemented:**

I built a Python notebook solving the 1D Poisson equation:

d²u/dx² = f(x), with u(0) = u(L) = 0

The Green's function turns out to be:
- G(x, x') = x(x' - L)/L for x ≤ x'
- G(x, x') = x'(x - L)/L for x > x'

**Cool findings:**

1. The Green's function is symmetric: G(x, x') = G(x', x). This reflects physical reciprocity - the response at A from a source at B equals the response at B from a source at A.

2. Numerical integration matched the analytical solution with maximum error ~10⁻¹⁵!

3. Also visualized the heat kernel - the Green's function for diffusion equations. It's a Gaussian that spreads out over time while maintaining total "mass" (integral = 1).

**Applications:**

Green's functions appear everywhere:
- Electrostatics (potential from charges)
- Heat conduction
- Quantum mechanics (propagators)
- Signal processing (impulse response)

Ever wondered how scientists solve equations for heat flow or electric fields?

Green's functions are the secret weapon! They capture how a system responds to a single point source - then you can build up ANY solution by adding these responses together.

I created an interactive Python notebook showing:
- Beautiful visualizations of Green's functions
- Numerical solutions matching theory perfectly
- The "heat kernel" - a spreading Gaussian that describes diffusion

**Mathematical Methods in Scientific Computing: Green's Functions**

Green's functions represent one of the most elegant techniques in applied mathematics, providing systematic solutions to linear differential equations through impulse response analysis.

**Technical Implementation:**

I developed a Python notebook demonstrating Green's function methods for the 1D Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The implementation includes:

- Analytical derivation of G(x, x') using continuity and jump conditions
- Numerical solution via scipy.integrate.quad
- Verification against closed-form solutions
- Visualization of the heat kernel (time-dependent Green's function)

**Key Results:**

- Maximum numerical error: O(10⁻¹⁵)
- Demonstrated reciprocity property G(x, x') = G(x', x)
- Verified conservation properties of diffusion kernels

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- Mathematical physics and differential equations
- Scientific Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)
- Numerical integration and error analysis
- Technical documentation and visualization

This methodology extends to electromagnetics, quantum mechanics, structural analysis, and control theory.

The math behind heat flow, electric fields, and quantum mechanics

Green's functions show how systems respond to a single point source. Once you know that response, you can solve for ANY source by integration.

This plot shows:
- Top left: Solution matching theory perfectly
- Top right: The source function -sin(πx)
- Bottom: Error analysis (tiny!)

The symmetry G(x,x') = G(x',x) reflects a beautiful physics principle: the response at A from source B equals response at B from source A.

Error achieved: 10⁻¹⁵
