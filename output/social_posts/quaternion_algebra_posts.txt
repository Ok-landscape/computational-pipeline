Quaternions: the 4D numbers that power every 3D rotation in games and aerospace. Hamilton carved i²=j²=k²=ijk=-1 into a bridge in 1843. Today we explore why they beat Euler angles.

Explored quaternion algebra today: these 4D hypercomplex numbers (q = w + xi + yj + zk) elegantly represent 3D rotations without gimbal lock.

Key insight: quaternion multiplication is non-commutative (ij = k, but ji = -k). Built a Python implementation with visualizations.

Ever wonder how video games rotate objects smoothly in 3D? The answer is quaternions.

Discovered by Hamilton in 1843, these 4D numbers follow weird rules: i² = j² = k² = ijk = -1

Unlike Euler angles, they don't suffer from gimbal lock. A unit quaternion q = cos(θ/2) + sin(θ/2)(nxi + nyj + nzk) rotates a vector by angle θ around axis n.

Built a Python class implementing the full algebra: conjugates, norms, inverses, and the Hamilton product. Visualized cube rotations!

Implemented quaternion algebra in Python today. These 4D hypercomplex numbers form a non-commutative division algebra over the reals.

Key properties verified:
- i² = j² = k² = ijk = -1
- ij = k but ji = -k (non-commutativity!)
- Unit quaternions double-cover SO(3)

Rotation formula: embed vector v as pure quaternion p, compute p' = qpq*

The Cayley table visualization shows the beautiful antisymmetric structure. No gimbal lock, smooth interpolation via SLERP.

**Title:** I built a quaternion algebra implementation in Python - here's how these 4D numbers elegantly solve 3D rotations

**Body:**

Hey everyone! I just finished implementing quaternion algebra from scratch and wanted to share what I learned.

**What are quaternions?**

Quaternions are 4D numbers discovered by William Rowan Hamilton in 1843. A quaternion q has the form:

q = w + xi + yj + zk

where w, x, y, z are real numbers, and i, j, k are special units satisfying i² = j² = k² = ijk = -1.

**Why should you care?**

If you've ever worked with 3D graphics, games, or robotics, you've probably encountered "gimbal lock" - that annoying singularity when using Euler angles. Quaternions solve this completely.

**The cool part: non-commutativity**

Unlike regular numbers, quaternion multiplication isn't commutative! ij = k, but ji = -k. My implementation's Cayley table visualization shows this beautiful antisymmetric structure.

**How rotations work**

A unit quaternion (with norm = 1) represents a rotation by angle θ around axis n:

q = cos(θ/2) + sin(θ/2) * (nx·i + ny·j + nz·k)

To rotate a vector v, you compute: v' = q · v · q*

**What I implemented:**
- Full Quaternion class with +, -, *, conjugate, norm, inverse
- Axis-angle to quaternion conversion
- Vector rotation
- Visualizations of cube rotation and composition

The double-cover property is fascinating: both q and -q represent the same rotation!

Ever wondered how video games rotate objects smoothly in 3D without glitching? The secret is quaternions - weird 4D numbers discovered in 1843!

Hamilton famously carved their defining equation i² = j² = k² = ijk = -1 into a bridge in Dublin.

Today I explored how these hypercomplex numbers elegantly encode rotations. Unlike simpler methods, they never "lock up" at certain angles.

Exploring Quaternion Algebra: Mathematical Foundations of Modern 3D Systems

Just completed a computational notebook exploring quaternion algebra - the mathematical framework underlying rotation systems in aerospace, robotics, and computer graphics.

Key technical insights:

1. Algebraic Structure: Quaternions form a 4D non-commutative division algebra over the reals, with basis elements satisfying Hamilton's relations (i² = j² = k² = ijk = -1)

2. Rotation Representation: Unit quaternions provide a singularity-free parameterization of SO(3), avoiding gimbal lock inherent in Euler angles

3. Computational Efficiency: Rotation via q·p·q* requires fewer operations than rotation matrices, with better numerical stability

4. Double Cover: The map from unit quaternions to rotations is 2-to-1, which has important implications for interpolation and control systems

Implementation includes a full Python Quaternion class with Hamilton product, conjugation, normalization, and axis-angle conversion. Visualizations demonstrate cube rotation and composition of sequential rotations.

Quaternions: the 4D math behind every smooth 3D rotation

Hamilton discovered these in 1843 and carved the equation into a bridge:
i² = j² = k² = ijk = -1

The plot shows:
- A cube rotating 45° around axis [1,1,1]
- The quaternion multiplication table (Cayley table)
- How rotations compose smoothly

No gimbal lock. No singularities.
Just elegant mathematics powering your games, VR headsets, and spacecraft.
