Only 23 people needed for a 50% chance two share a birthday? 🎂

The secret: it's not 23 vs 365 days. It's 253 pairwise comparisons!

P(match) = 1 - ∏(365-i)/365

Monte Carlo simulation confirms the math.

The Birthday Paradox: With just 23 people, there's a 50.7% chance two share a birthday.

Why? We're not comparing people to days—we're counting pairs: C(23,2) = 253 comparisons.

Verified with 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations. Theory and simulation match beautifully.

Here's a probability puzzle that tricks almost everyone:

How many people do you need in a room for a 50% chance that two share a birthday?

Most guess around 180. The answer? Just 23.

The trick is we're not asking "does someone share MY birthday" — we're asking about ANY pair. With 23 people, that's 253 possible pairs to check!

I ran 10,000 simulations and the results match the theory perfectly. By 70 people, you're at 99.9% probability.

Math is wild sometimes.

Birthday Paradox simulation complete.

Key results:
• n=23: P(match) = 0.5073 (crossover point)
• n=50: P(match) ≈ 0.97
• n=70: P(match) > 0.999

The formula: P(match) = 1 - ∏ᵢ₌₀ⁿ⁻¹ (365-i)/365

The "paradox" emerges because pairwise comparisons grow as n(n-1)/2, not linearly. With 23 people: 253 pairs.

Monte Carlo validation (10,000 trials) shows excellent agreement with theory.

Applications: cryptographic birthday attacks, hash collision estimation, duplicate detection.

**Title:** I simulated the Birthday Paradox with Monte Carlo methods - here's why only 23 people gives you 50% odds

**Body:**

Ever heard that you only need 23 people for a 50% chance two share a birthday? I always thought this was a trick until I actually coded it up.

**The intuition trap:**

We naturally compare 23 people to 365 days and think "no way." But we're asking the wrong question. We're not checking if someone shares YOUR birthday—we're checking if ANY two people match.

**The math:**

With n people, the number of pairs to compare is n(n-1)/2

For 23 people: 23 × 22 / 2 = 253 pairs!

The exact probability: P(match) = 1 - ∏ (365-i)/365 for i from 0 to n-1

**My simulation:**

I ran 10,000 Monte Carlo trials for each group size from 1 to 80. The simulated results match the theoretical curve almost perfectly.

Key findings:
- n=23: P = 0.5073 (the crossover!)
- n=50: P ≈ 0.97
- n=70: P > 0.999

**Why this matters:**

This isn't just a party trick. The same principle underlies:
- Birthday attacks in cryptography (breaking hash functions in 2^(n/2) instead of 2^n operations)
- Hash table collision estimation
- Duplicate detection in databases

The code uses NumPy for random birthday generation and Matplotlib for visualization. Clean, readable, and reproducible.

Here's a fun probability puzzle: How many people need to be in a room before there's a 50% chance two share a birthday?

The answer is just 23! 🎂

It seems impossible when there are 365 days to choose from. But the secret is that with 23 people, you're actually making 253 different pair comparisons.

I built a simulation running 10,000 random trials and the results match the mathematical prediction perfectly. By 50 people, you're at 97% probability!

Exploring the Birthday Paradox: A Monte Carlo Simulation Study

I recently completed a computational exploration of the Birthday Paradox—a classic result in probability theory with significant applications in computer science.

**Key Technical Findings:**

The crossover point (P > 0.5) occurs at just n = 23 people. This counterintuitive result stems from combinatorial growth: pairwise comparisons scale as n(n-1)/2, giving 253 comparisons for 23 people.

**Methodology:**

• Implemented exact theoretical probability calculation
• Ran 10,000 Monte Carlo simulation trials per group size
• Validated simulation accuracy against analytical solution

**Results:**

The empirical simulations show excellent agreement with theory across all group sizes (1-80), demonstrating the reliability of Monte Carlo methods for probability estimation.

**Practical Applications:**

This principle is foundational in cryptography (birthday attacks reduce hash function security from 2^n to 2^(n/2) operations), database systems (collision probability in hash tables), and quality control (duplicate detection).

Skills demonstrated: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, statistical simulation, probability theory.

THE BIRTHDAY PARADOX 🎂

How many people for a 50% chance two share a birthday?

Answer: Only 23!

Why it works:
→ 23 people = 253 pairs to compare
→ Each pair has a 1/365 chance of matching
→ Probabilities compound quickly

The math checks out:
• 23 people: 50.7%
• 50 people: 97%
• 70 people: 99.9%

I ran 10,000 simulations and they match the theory perfectly ✓

This same principle is used to break encryption—it's called a "birthday attack" and it's why hash functions need to be so long.
