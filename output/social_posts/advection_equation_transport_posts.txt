Simulated wave transport with the advection equation! Compared upwind vs Lax-Wendroff schemes:
- Upwind: diffusive but stable
- Lax-Wendroff: accurate but oscillatory

CFL condition ν = cΔt/Δx ≤ 1 keeps it stable.

Explored the advection equation ∂u/∂t + c·∂u/∂x = 0, which describes how quantities like temperature or concentration transport through space.

Implemented upwind (1st order) and Lax-Wendroff (2nd order) schemes. Convergence verified: O(Δx) vs O(Δx²).

Ever wonder how pollutants spread in the atmosphere or how waves propagate?

The advection equation is one of the simplest ways to model transport: ∂u/∂t + c·∂u/∂x = 0

I implemented two numerical schemes:
• Upwind: spreads the solution (numerical diffusion)
• Lax-Wendroff: creates ripples near sharp edges (dispersion)

The key insight? First-order schemes smear things out, second-order schemes create oscillations. Real applications need clever combinations of both!

Implemented numerical solvers for the 1D advection equation using Python/NumPy.

Equation: ∂u/∂t + c·∂u/∂x = 0
Solution: u(x,t) = u₀(x - ct)

Schemes compared:
• Upwind: u_j^(n+1) = u_j^n - ν(u_j^n - u_(j-1)^n)
• Lax-Wendroff: 2nd-order accurate, uses centered differences + correction

Key findings:
- Upwind has O(Δx) convergence, numerical diffusion
- Lax-Wendroff has O(Δx²) convergence, numerical dispersion
- CFL condition ν ≤ 1 required for stability

**Title:** I built a Python simulation comparing numerical schemes for wave transport (advection equation) - here's what I learned about diffusion vs dispersion

**Body:**

Hey r/learnpython!

I've been learning about partial differential equations and wanted to share a simulation I built that reveals something really interesting about numerical methods.

**The Problem: How do things move?**

The advection equation describes how a quantity (like dye in water, smoke in air, or temperature) gets carried along by a flow:

∂u/∂t + c·∂u/∂x = 0

The beautiful thing is this has an exact solution: whatever shape you start with just slides along at speed c without changing.

**The Challenge: Computers can't do calculus directly**

So we approximate derivatives using finite differences. But here's where it gets interesting - different approximations have wildly different behavior!

**What I implemented:**

1. **Upwind scheme** (1st order): Uses the point "upwind" from where information flows
2. **Lax-Wendroff scheme** (2nd order): More accurate but more complex

**The surprising result:**

- Upwind scheme causes **diffusion** - peaks get shorter and spread out (like adding blur)
- Lax-Wendroff causes **dispersion** - creates oscillations near sharp edges (like ringing artifacts)

This explains why weather models, game physics, and CFD codes use sophisticated "high-resolution" schemes that combine the best of both approaches!

**Technical details:**
- Grid: 100 points, 100 time steps
- Verified convergence rates match theory: O(Δx) for upwind, O(Δx²) for Lax-Wendroff
- CFL stability condition: ν = cΔt/Δx ≤ 1

Ever watched smoke drift through the air or dye spread in water? That's advection - one of the most fundamental ways things move in nature!

I built a computer simulation to model this and discovered something cool: the way you approximate the math creates either "blur" (numerical diffusion) or "ripples" (numerical dispersion).

This is why accurate weather prediction and video game physics are so hard - you need clever tricks to avoid these artifacts!

**Numerical Methods for Transport Phenomena: A Comparative Study**

Recently completed a computational study comparing finite difference schemes for solving the advection equation, a fundamental PDE in fluid dynamics and atmospheric modeling.

**Technical Approach:**
Implemented and validated two classical schemes:
• First-order upwind: Demonstrates numerical diffusion, O(Δx) convergence
• Second-order Lax-Wendroff: Exhibits numerical dispersion, O(Δx²) convergence

**Key Findings:**
The study reveals the fundamental trade-off in numerical PDE methods: low-order schemes introduce artificial diffusion that smears solutions, while higher-order schemes generate dispersive oscillations near discontinuities.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- PDE discretization and finite difference methods
- Python/NumPy scientific computing
- Numerical analysis (stability via CFL condition, convergence verification)
- Data visualization with Matplotlib

This work provides foundational understanding for more advanced methods like ENO/WENO schemes used in production CFD codes.

Waves, smoke, and dye all follow the same equation when they drift through space.

I simulated how different numerical methods handle this transport:

→ First method: blurs everything (like a bad photo filter)
→ Second method: creates ripples at edges (like digital ringing)

Neither is perfect alone - real simulations combine clever tricks from both!

The plot shows a Gaussian pulse and square wave being transported. Notice how the square wave's sharp edges really reveal the numerical artifacts.

Science is beautiful when you can see the math come alive!
