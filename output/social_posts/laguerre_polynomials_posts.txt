Ever wondered how electrons orbit atoms? Laguerre polynomials describe hydrogen's electron shells! L_n(x) with weight e^(-x) orthogonal on [0,∞)

Verified orthogonality: ∫₀^∞ e^(-x)·L_m(x)·L_n(x) dx = δ_mn

Explored Laguerre polynomials today - the mathematical backbone of hydrogen atom wave functions.

Key insight: These polynomials are orthogonal with weight e^(-x) on [0,∞), making them perfect for quantum mechanical calculations.

Implemented recurrence relation & Gauss-Laguerre quadrature in Python.

Just finished a deep dive into Laguerre polynomials!

These special functions pop up everywhere in physics - most famously in describing where electrons "live" around hydrogen atoms.

The cool part? They satisfy:
(n+1)·L_{n+1}(x) = (2n+1-x)·L_n(x) - n·L_{n-1}(x)

This recurrence relation makes them computationally efficient. Verified orthogonality numerically: the integral ∫₀^∞ e^(-x)·L_m·L_n dx equals 1 when m=n and 0 otherwise.

Also explored Gauss-Laguerre quadrature - just 5 points gives exact results for polynomials up to degree 9!

Computational exploration of Laguerre polynomials with full Python implementation.

Mathematical highlights:
- Rodrigues formula: L_n(x) = (e^x/n!)·(d^n/dx^n)(e^(-x)·x^n)
- Orthogonality: ∫₀^∞ e^(-x)·L_m(x)·L_n(x) dx = δ_mn
- Recurrence: (n+1)·L_{n+1} = (2n+1-x)·L_n - n·L_{n-1}

Applied to hydrogen atom radial wave functions R_nl(r), showing probability densities for 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d orbitals.

Gauss-Laguerre quadrature converges to machine precision with ~5 nodes for polynomial integrands.

**Title:** Implemented Laguerre Polynomials in Python - From Math Theory to Hydrogen Atom Wave Functions

**Body:**

I built a computational notebook exploring Laguerre polynomials and wanted to share what I learned!

**What are Laguerre polynomials?**

They're a family of orthogonal polynomials that are solutions to a specific differential equation:

x·(d²L_n/dx²) + (1-x)·(dL_n/dx) + n·L_n = 0

The first few are simple:
- L_0(x) = 1
- L_1(x) = 1 - x
- L_2(x) = 1 - 2x + x²/2

**Why should you care?**

The radial wave functions of the hydrogen atom (yes, actual quantum mechanics!) are expressed using associated Laguerre polynomials. When you see those familiar orbital shapes (1s, 2p, 3d), Laguerre polynomials are doing the heavy lifting.

**Implementation highlights:**

1. Built a recurrence-based calculator that matches SciPy to machine precision
2. Numerically verified orthogonality - the integral ∫₀^∞ e^(-x)·L_m(x)·L_n(x) dx really does equal δ_mn
3. Computed hydrogen atom radial probability densities for various quantum states
4. Demonstrated Gauss-Laguerre quadrature - with just 5 nodes, you get exact integrals for polynomials up to degree 9!

**What I learned:**

The orthogonality property with weight e^(-x) on [0,∞) is what makes these polynomials so useful. Unlike Legendre (bounded interval) or Hermite (Gaussian weight), Laguerre polynomials naturally handle semi-infinite domains with exponential decay - exactly what you need for atomic physics.

Just explored the mathematics behind electron orbitals!

Laguerre polynomials might sound abstract, but they're the key to understanding where electrons "live" around atoms.

My Python notebook:
- Visualizes the first 6 polynomials
- Proves their orthogonality numerically
- Calculates actual hydrogen atom wave functions
- Shows probability densities for different orbitals (1s, 2p, 3d...)

The best part? The recurrence formula makes them super efficient to compute. Math + physics + coding = beautiful science!

Computational Exploration: Laguerre Polynomials and Quantum Mechanical Applications

I recently completed a technical notebook implementing Laguerre polynomials from first principles, demonstrating their application in quantum mechanics.

Key Technical Achievements:

1. Algorithm Implementation: Developed both recurrence-based and explicit formula implementations, verified against SciPy to machine precision (error < 10^(-14))

2. Numerical Analysis: Quantitatively verified orthogonality relations through numerical integration, confirming ∫₀^∞ e^(-x)·L_m(x)·L_n(x) dx = δ_mn

3. Physics Application: Computed hydrogen atom radial wave functions R_nl(r) for quantum states (n,l) = (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), visualizing probability density distributions

4. Quadrature Methods: Implemented Gauss-Laguerre numerical integration, demonstrating rapid convergence - 5 quadrature points yield exact results for polynomial integrands

Technologies: Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib

This project reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical foundations when working with scientific computing libraries. The connection between abstract orthogonal polynomials and tangible physical predictions exemplifies why computational literacy matters in technical fields.

The math behind atomic orbitals ✨

Laguerre polynomials describe where electrons exist around hydrogen atoms.

What you're seeing:
↳ Top left: First 6 Laguerre polynomials
↳ Top right: Associated polynomials (with parameter α)
↳ Bottom left: Weighted functions showing decay
↳ Bottom right: Zeros pattern (used in numerical integration)

The beautiful part?
They're orthogonal on [0,∞) with weight e^(-x)

Verified numerically:
∫₀^∞ e^(-x)·L_m·L_n dx = 1 if m=n, else 0

From abstract math to real quantum mechanics!
