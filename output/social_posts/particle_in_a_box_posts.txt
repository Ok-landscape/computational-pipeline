Quantum confinement in action! An electron trapped in a 1nm box can only have discrete energies: E_n = n²π²ℏ²/(2mL²)

Ground state = 0.38 eV, but n=5 has 25x more energy!

Zero-point energy means particles never truly rest.

Explored the particle in a box - a cornerstone of quantum mechanics.

Key insight: Energy is quantized as E_n ∝ n², meaning the n=5 state has 25 times the ground state energy.

The wave functions ψ_n(x) = √(2/L)·sin(nπx/L) beautifully show how confinement leads to standing waves.

Just simulated one of quantum mechanics' most elegant problems: the particle in a box.

Imagine an electron trapped in a tiny 1 nanometer box. Unlike classical physics, it can't have just any energy - only specific quantized values!

The ground state (n=1) has 0.38 eV, while n=5 jumps to 9.4 eV. That's the n² scaling in action.

What's wild: even at the lowest energy state, the particle has non-zero "zero-point energy." Quantum particles never truly stop moving.

The wave functions form perfect standing waves with (n-1) nodes. Math + physics = beautiful.

Implemented the infinite square well (particle in a box) in Python using NumPy and SciPy.

For an electron in a 1nm box:
• E₁ = 0.376 eV (ground state)
• E_n = n²·E₁ (quantization)
• ψ_n(x) = √(2/L)·sin(nπx/L)

Verified orthonormality numerically: ⟨ψ_m|ψ_n⟩ = δ_mn

Key physics: The expectation value ⟨x⟩ = L/2 for all states due to potential symmetry, but position uncertainty Δx varies with quantum number.

Zero-point energy E₁ ≠ 0 is a direct consequence of the uncertainty principle.

**Title:** [OC] Visualizing the Particle in a Box - Quantum Mechanics with Python

**Body:**

I built a Python simulation of the particle in a box problem, one of the most fundamental models in quantum mechanics.

**ELI5:** Imagine trapping an electron in a tiny box. In classical physics, the electron could have any energy. But quantum mechanics says no - the electron can only have specific energy values, like steps on a ladder. The smallest energy (ground state) isn't zero - the particle always has some "jiggle" even at minimum energy.

**What I learned:**

The energy levels follow E_n = n²π²ℏ²/(2mL²), which means:
- n=1 (ground state): 0.38 eV
- n=2: 1.50 eV (4x ground state)
- n=5: 9.40 eV (25x ground state)

The wave functions are sine waves: ψ_n(x) = √(2/L)·sin(nπx/L)

Each higher state has one more node (zero crossing) inside the box. The probability density |ψ|² tells you where you're likely to find the particle.

**Cool insight:** I verified that the wave functions are orthonormal - the integral ⟨ψ_m|ψ_n⟩ = 1 when m=n and 0 otherwise. This is why they form a complete basis in quantum mechanics.

**Code highlights:**
- Used scipy.constants for physical constants (ℏ, m_e)
- Numerical integration with np.trapz for expectation values
- Clean visualization with matplotlib showing wave functions, probability densities, and energy diagrams

**View and run the notebook:** https://cocalc.com/github/Ok-landscape/computational-pipeline/blob/main/notebooks/published/particle_in_a_box.ipynb

The visualization shows the wave functions offset by their energy levels - a standard way to see how higher energy states have more oscillations.

This model is the foundation for understanding quantum dots, molecular orbitals, and semiconductor physics!

Just explored one of quantum mechanics' most beautiful puzzles: What happens when you trap a particle in a tiny box?

Unlike our everyday world, electrons in nanoscale boxes can only have specific energy values - like musical notes on a scale. The smallest energy isn't zero (zero-point energy), because quantum particles never truly stop moving.

I visualized the first 5 quantum states and their wave functions. Higher states = more waves = more energy!

Computational Physics Project: Quantum Particle in a Box Simulation

I developed a Python-based simulation of the infinite square well problem, demonstrating fundamental quantum mechanical principles through numerical computation.

**Technical Implementation:**
• Calculated quantized energy eigenvalues: E_n = n²π²ℏ²/(2mL²)
• Computed normalized wave functions using analytical solutions
• Verified orthonormality through numerical integration (trapezoidal rule)
• Generated publication-quality visualizations of wave functions and probability densities

**Key Results:**
For an electron confined to 1nm:
- Ground state energy: 0.376 eV
- Energy scaling: E_n ∝ n² demonstrates quadratic quantization
- All states satisfy ⟨x⟩ = L/2 due to potential symmetry

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Scientific Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)
- Quantum mechanics fundamentals
- Numerical methods for physics
- Technical visualization and documentation

This foundational model extends to real-world applications including quantum dots, semiconductor nanostructures, and molecular orbital theory.

Quantum mechanics in one image.

This is what happens when you trap an electron in a box just 1 nanometer wide.

The colored curves? Those are wave functions - probability waves that tell us where the electron might be found.

Here's the mind-bending part:

→ The particle can only have specific energies (quantization)
→ Higher states have more "wiggles" (nodes)
→ Even at minimum energy, it's never at rest

n=1: 0.38 eV
n=5: 9.40 eV

That's a 25x energy jump from just changing the quantum number.

The universe doesn't do continuous at small scales - it does discrete.
