Why do some network nodes become "hubs"? The Barabási-Albert model shows: rich get richer!

New nodes prefer connecting to popular ones → P(k) ~ k⁻³

Explored the Barabási-Albert model for scale-free networks.

Key insight: preferential attachment creates power-law degree distributions.

Probability of connection: Π(kᵢ) = kᵢ/Σⱼkⱼ (rich-get-richer)

Result: P(k) ~ k⁻³ confirmed with 10,000-node simulation.

Ever wonder why some websites get all the links while others stay invisible?

It's called preferential attachment - "the rich get richer"

I simulated the Barabási-Albert model with 10,000 nodes:
→ New nodes connect to popular nodes with probability proportional to their degree
→ This creates hub nodes with HUGE connectivity
→ Degree distribution follows a power law: P(k) ~ k⁻³

The math is elegant: kᵢ(t) = m√(t/tᵢ)

Early nodes grow bigger over time. Just like real social networks!

Implemented the Barabási-Albert scale-free network model from scratch.

Preferential attachment mechanism:
Π(kᵢ) = kᵢ / Σⱼkⱼ

Simulated N=10,000 nodes, m=3 edges per new node.

Results:
• Mean degree ⟨k⟩ = 2m = 6 (confirmed)
• Fitted γ ≈ 3.0 (matches theory)
• Power-law degree distribution: P(k) ~ k⁻³

The continuum theory derivation is beautiful - solving ∂kᵢ/∂t = kᵢ/2t gives degree evolution kᵢ(t) ~ t^(1/2).

**Title:** I built a Barabási-Albert scale-free network simulator in Python - here's how "rich get richer" creates network hubs

**Body:**

Hey everyone! I just finished a project exploring scale-free networks and wanted to share what I learned.

**What's a scale-free network?**

Unlike random networks where all nodes have similar connections, scale-free networks have a few "hub" nodes with tons of connections and many nodes with just a few. Think of it like social media influencers - a handful have millions of followers, most have a few dozen.

**The Barabási-Albert Model**

This model explains how scale-free networks form through two simple rules:
1. Growth: Network keeps adding new nodes
2. Preferential attachment: New nodes prefer connecting to already-popular nodes

The probability that a new node connects to node i is:

Π(kᵢ) = kᵢ / (sum of all degrees)

So if node i has 100 connections and the total is 1000, there's a 10% chance the new node connects to it. Popular nodes get more popular!

**The Math (ELI5 version)**

This "rich get richer" leads to a power-law distribution: P(k) ~ k⁻³

This means if you double the number of connections (k), the probability of having that many drops by 8x (2³). Very few hubs, lots of small nodes.

**My Implementation**

I simulated 10,000 nodes with m=3 edges per new node. Key results:
- Mean degree: 6.0 (matches theory: 2m)
- Fitted exponent γ ≈ 3.0 (exactly as predicted!)
- Top hub had over 200 connections while average was 6

**What I Learned**

Simple local rules (connect to popular nodes) create complex global patterns (power-law distribution). This same mechanism appears in the World Wide Web, citation networks, and biological networks.

The code is pure Python with numpy/matplotlib - no networkx needed!

Ever notice how some things just get more and more popular while others stay unknown?

There's actually math behind this! It's called preferential attachment - "the rich get richer."

I simulated a network of 10,000 nodes using the Barabási-Albert model. New nodes prefer connecting to already-popular nodes, which creates "hubs" - just like social media influencers or popular websites.

The result? A power law: P(k) ~ k⁻³

Simple rules → complex patterns!

How do network hubs emerge? A Python implementation of the Barabási-Albert model.

I recently completed a computational study of scale-free networks, implementing the Barabási-Albert (BA) model from scratch to understand preferential attachment dynamics.

Key technical approach:
• Built a generative network model simulating growth with preferential attachment
• Implemented efficient sampling using repeated-node lists for O(1) attachment probability
• Validated against theoretical predictions using power-law fitting

Results from N=10,000 node simulation:
• Degree distribution follows P(k) ~ k⁻γ with γ = 3.0 (matching Barabási & Albert's 1999 theory)
• Mean degree ⟨k⟩ = 2m confirmed
• Verified continuum theory: degree evolution kᵢ(t) = m√(t/tᵢ)

The model demonstrates how simple local rules (preferential attachment) generate complex global structure (scale-free topology). This mechanism underlies many real networks: WWW hyperlinks, academic citations, and protein interactions.

Skills demonstrated: Python, NumPy, statistical analysis, mathematical modeling, data visualization.

Why do some accounts explode while others stay small?

This visualization shows a scale-free network simulation.

The math is elegant:
