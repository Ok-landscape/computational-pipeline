How biased is a coin? Bayesian inference lets you update your beliefs with each flip.

Starting from any prior, the posterior converges to the truth: θ ≈ 0.7 after 100 flips.

Implemented Bayesian inference for coin bias estimation using Beta-Binomial conjugacy.

Key insight: With enough data, your posterior mean converges regardless of prior choice.

After 100 flips, all priors agreed: θ ≈ 0.70

Ever wondered how to scientifically determine if a coin is fair?

Bayesian inference provides the answer. You start with a belief (prior), observe data, and update using Bayes' theorem:

P(θ|D) = P(D|θ) × P(θ) / P(D)

I tested 4 different priors - from uniform to strongly biased - and watched them all converge to the true value θ = 0.7 after just 100 coin flips.

The beauty? You get uncertainty estimates too, not just point values. That's the Bayesian way.

New notebook: Bayesian Inference for Coin Flip Experiments

Implemented the full Beta-Binomial conjugate model for estimating coin bias θ.

Key results:
• Posterior: Beta(α + k, β + n - k)
• Mean: E[θ|D] = (α + k)/(α + β + n)
• All 4 priors converged to θ ≈ 0.70 after 100 observations
• 95% credible intervals all contained true θ = 0.7

The elegance of conjugate priors: closed-form updates with full uncertainty quantification.

**Title:** Implemented Bayesian Inference from Scratch to Estimate Coin Bias - Here's What I Learned

**Body:**

I built a Python notebook demonstrating Bayesian inference for the classic coin flip problem. Here's the ELI5 and what I learned.

**The Problem:**
You have a coin with unknown probability θ of landing heads. You flip it n times, see k heads. What's θ?

**The Bayesian Approach:**

Instead of just calculating k/n, Bayesian inference gives you a full probability distribution over θ.

The formula: P(θ|Data) ∝ P(Data|θ) × P(θ)

Translation: Your updated belief = (how likely this data is if θ is true) × (your prior belief about θ)

**Why Beta Distribution?**

The magic is using a Beta prior, which is "conjugate" to the binomial likelihood. This means:
- Prior: Beta(α, β)
- Posterior: Beta(α + heads, β + tails)

That's it! No complex integrals needed.

**The Experiment:**

I simulated 100 flips from a coin with true bias θ = 0.7, then tested 4 different priors:
1. Uniform (no prior knowledge)
2. Skeptical (believes coin is fair)
3. Strong prior at 0.5
4. Prior favoring heads

**Key Finding:**

After 100 observations, ALL priors converged to approximately θ = 0.70 with narrow credible intervals. The data overwhelms the prior.

**Takeaways:**
- Bayesian inference quantifies uncertainty, not just point estimates
- Conjugate priors make computation elegant
- With enough data, prior choice matters less
- You get credible intervals that actually mean "95% probability θ is in this range"

How do you figure out if a coin is biased?

I built a Python simulation using Bayesian inference - a method that updates your beliefs as you gather evidence.

The cool part: I started with 4 completely different assumptions about the coin's fairness. After just 100 flips, they ALL converged to the same answer (θ ≈ 0.70).

This is the power of evidence over opinion - with enough data, the truth wins out.

Bayesian Inference in Practice: A Computational Demonstration

I recently developed a Python notebook implementing Bayesian inference for parameter estimation, using the canonical coin flip problem as a case study.

**Technical Approach:**
• Leveraged Beta-Binomial conjugacy for closed-form posterior updates
• Implemented sequential Bayesian updating to visualize belief evolution
• Conducted sensitivity analysis across four distinct prior specifications

**Key Findings:**
The posterior mean E[θ|D] = (α + k)/(α + β + n) converged to the true parameter value (0.70) regardless of prior choice after sufficient observations. All 95% credible intervals contained the true value.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Statistical modeling with scipy.stats
- Uncertainty quantification
- Scientific visualization with matplotlib
- Experimental design and sensitivity analysis

**Insight:**
Bayesian methods provide principled uncertainty quantification - critical for decision-making in data science applications where point estimates alone are insufficient.

Bayesian Inference Visualized

How do you figure out if a coin is fair?

Start with a belief.
Flip the coin.
Update your belief.
Repeat.

This plot shows 4 different starting beliefs (priors) all converging to the same answer after 100 coin flips.

The purple curves = more data = more certainty.

The red dashed line = the truth (θ = 0.7).

Math is beautiful when you can watch beliefs transform into knowledge.
