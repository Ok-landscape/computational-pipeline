Implemented the Jacobi iterative method for solving linear systems Ax = b.

The algorithm decomposes A = D + R and iterates until convergence.

Convergence guaranteed when spectral radius ρ(G) < 1.

Visualized eigenvalue distribution and error decay.

Ever wondered how computers solve massive systems of equations?

The Jacobi method breaks it down beautifully:

1. Split matrix A into diagonal (D) and remainder (R)
2. Iterate: x_new = D⁻¹(b - R·x_old)
3. Repeat until convergence!

The magic? Each component updates independently - perfect for parallel computing.

Tested on a 50×50 system and watched the error decay exponentially. Diagonal dominance is key: stronger dominance = faster convergence.

New notebook: Jacobi Iterative Method for linear systems

Solving Ax = b by decomposition A = D + R

Iteration formula: xᵢ⁽ᵏ⁺¹⁾ = (1/aᵢᵢ)(bᵢ - Σⱼ≠ᵢ aᵢⱼxⱼ⁽ᵏ⁾)

Key results:
- Convergence requires ρ(D⁻¹R) < 1
- Error bound: ‖e⁽ᵏ⁾‖ ≤ ‖G‖ᵏ‖e⁽⁰⁾‖
- Stronger diagonal dominance → smaller spectral radius → faster convergence

Includes eigenvalue visualization of iteration matrix.

**Title:** Implemented the Jacobi Iterative Method in Python - Visual guide to solving linear systems

**Body:**

I built a Python notebook exploring the Jacobi iterative method for solving systems of linear equations (Ax = b).

**ELI5 Version:**
Imagine you have a bunch of equations with unknowns. Instead of solving them all at once (which gets hard with big systems), Jacobi takes a guess and keeps improving it. Each round, it updates every variable using the current values of the others. It's like a group project where everyone works on their part simultaneously!

**What I learned:**

1. **The Algorithm:** Split your matrix into diagonal (D) and off-diagonal (R) parts. Then iterate: x_new = D⁻¹(b - R·x_old)

2. **Convergence:** The method works when the matrix is "diagonally dominant" - meaning diagonal elements dominate their rows. Mathematically, the spectral radius ρ(G) must be < 1.

3. **Speed depends on diagonal dominance:**
   - Factor 1.5 → ~97 iterations
   - Factor 5.0 → ~24 iterations

4. **Parallelizable:** Unlike Gauss-Seidel, all components update independently - great for GPU computing!

The visualization shows how eigenvalues of the iteration matrix cluster inside the unit circle (guaranteeing convergence) and how error decays exponentially.

Code uses only NumPy and Matplotlib - no exotic dependencies!

How do computers solve systems with 50 equations and 50 unknowns?

The Jacobi method is elegantly simple: make a guess, then keep improving it by updating each variable one iteration at a time.

The cool part? It's guaranteed to work when the diagonal elements dominate - and you can literally watch the error shrink exponentially!

Built this interactive notebook with convergence visualizations.

**Numerical Methods Deep Dive: Jacobi Iterative Method**

Just published an educational notebook implementing the Jacobi iterative method for solving linear systems Ax = b.

**Technical Highlights:**

• Implemented from scratch using NumPy with O(n²) per-iteration complexity
• Analyzed convergence via spectral radius of iteration matrix G = D⁻¹R
• Demonstrated that diagonal dominance factor directly impacts convergence speed
• Visualized eigenvalue distribution showing stability region (unit circle)

**Key Findings:**

The method converges linearly with rate governed by ρ(G). Testing showed that increasing diagonal dominance from 1.5× to 5× reduced iterations from ~97 to ~24 for equivalent accuracy.

**Why It Matters:**

Jacobi's embarrassingly parallel nature makes it relevant for modern GPU computing and distributed systems, despite being "slower" than Gauss-Seidel in sequential execution.

**Skills Demonstrated:** Numerical linear algebra, iterative methods, convergence analysis, scientific visualization
