SO(3): the math behind every 3D rotation you've ever seen.

Orthogonal matrices + det = 1 = all possible rotations in 3D space.

Fun fact: Rotations don't commute! RxRy ≠ RyRx

Explored SO(3) - the Lie group of 3D rotations. Every rotation matrix R satisfies R^T R = I with det(R) = 1.

The exponential map (Rodrigues' formula) connects the Lie algebra so(3) to rotation matrices.

Key insight: rotations are non-commutative!

Ever wondered about the math behind 3D rotations?

Meet SO(3) - a "Lie group" that describes ALL proper rotations in 3D space.

What makes it special:
- Matrices where R^T R = I (orthogonal)
- Determinant = 1 (no reflections)
- Non-commutative: rotating X then Y ≠ Y then X

The "Rodrigues formula" lets you smoothly interpolate between any two orientations - crucial for robotics, graphics, and physics!

Implemented it in Python with visualizations.

Deep dive into SO(3) - the special orthogonal group in 3 dimensions.

Mathematically: SO(3) = {R in R^(3x3) : R^T R = I, det(R) = 1}

The Lie algebra so(3) consists of skew-symmetric matrices. Any 3x3 skew-symmetric matrix A can be written using the "hat map" from an angular velocity vector omega.

The exponential map exp: so(3) -> SO(3) is given by Rodrigues' formula:
exp([omega]_x) = I + (sin(theta)/theta)[omega]_x + ((1-cos(theta))/theta^2)[omega]_x^2

Verified numerically in Python!

Title: Implemented the Lie Group SO(3) in Python - The Math Behind 3D Rotations

Body:

**TL;DR:** Built a Python implementation of SO(3), the mathematical structure describing all 3D rotations. Includes the exponential map, logarithm, and geodesic interpolation (SLERP).

**What is SO(3)?**

Imagine you have a rigid object in 3D space. Any way you can rotate it (without flipping it inside-out) corresponds to an element of SO(3). Mathematically, it's the set of 3x3 matrices R where:

- R^T R = I (orthogonal - preserves lengths and angles)
- det(R) = 1 (no reflections allowed)

**Why should you care?**

SO(3) appears everywhere:
- Robotics (end-effector orientations)
- Computer graphics (camera rotations, animation)
- Physics (rigid body dynamics, quantum mechanics)
- Aerospace (satellite attitude control)

**Cool discovery: Rotations don't commute!**

If you rotate around X-axis then Y-axis, you get a different result than Y then X. My code calculates the "commutator angle" between these - about 24 degrees for pi/4 and pi/3 rotations!

**The Rodrigues Formula**

The exponential map connects the Lie algebra (infinitesimal rotations) to actual rotation matrices:

exp([omega]_x) = I + (sin(theta)/theta)[omega]_x + ((1-cos(theta))/theta^2)[omega]_x^2

This formula is numerically stable and efficient.

**What I implemented:**
- hat/vee maps (vector <-> skew-symmetric matrix)
- Exponential map (Rodrigues' formula)
- Logarithm map (inverse of exp)
- SLERP (geodesic interpolation between rotations)

The mathematics of rotation is beautiful.

SO(3) - the "special orthogonal group" - describes every possible rotation in 3D space. No flips, no stretches, just pure rotation.

What's fascinating is that rotations don't behave like regular numbers. Rotate around X then Y? Different result than Y then X! This non-commutativity is captured by something called a "Lie algebra."

Created a Python notebook exploring this with visualizations.

Exploring the Mathematics of 3D Rotations: A Deep Dive into SO(3)

I recently implemented a comprehensive Python library for working with the special orthogonal group SO(3) - the mathematical foundation of 3D rotations used across robotics, computer graphics, aerospace, and physics.

Key technical implementations:

- Hat/Vee maps: Bijection between R^3 and the Lie algebra so(3)
- Rodrigues' rotation formula: Numerically stable exponential map
- Logarithm map: Inverse mapping from SO(3) to so(3)
- SLERP: Geodesic interpolation for smooth rotation transitions

Technical insight: The non-commutativity of rotations (RxRy != RyRx) is elegantly captured by the Lie bracket structure, which is isomorphic to the cross product in R^3.

Applications:
- Robotics: Inverse kinematics and end-effector control
- Graphics: Smooth camera interpolation
- Physics: Rigid body dynamics simulation

The numerical verification confirms machine-precision accuracy for orthogonality and determinant constraints.

The geometry of rotation.

SO(3) - every possible way to rotate an object in 3D without flipping it.

What you're seeing:
- Coordinate frames spinning around different axes
- Non-commutativity: order matters!
- Geodesic paths: the "shortest" rotation between two orientations

Used in robotics, animation, physics, and VR.

Built with Python + NumPy + Matplotlib.
