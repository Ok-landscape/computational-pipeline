How do you measure distance on a curved surface?

The metric tensor g_μν tells you: ds² = g_μν dx^μ dx^ν

The metric tensor is the foundation of differential geometry - it generalizes the Pythagorean theorem to curved spaces.

Implemented a Python class computing:
- Line elements ds² = g_μν dx^μ dx^ν
- Gaussian curvature K = 1/R² for spheres
- Geodesic distances

Visualization included.

Ever wondered how GPS knows the shortest path between two cities on a curved Earth?

The answer: the metric tensor.

It's a mathematical object that tells you how to measure distances on ANY surface - flat, spherical, or wildly curved like a donut.

I coded up a Python implementation that computes:
- Distance elements
- Angles between vectors
- Gaussian curvature
- Path lengths

The visualization shows how "unit circles" distort across different geometries. Pretty wild how a sphere has constant curvature K=1/R² everywhere!

Implemented the metric tensor g_μν in Python for differential geometry computations.

Key features:
- Line element: ds² = g_μν dx^μ dx^ν
- Inverse metric via g^μλ g_λν = δ^μ_ν
- Christoffel symbols: Γ^λ_μν = ½g^λσ(∂_μ g_νσ + ∂_ν g_μσ - ∂_σ g_μν)
- Gaussian curvature from Riemann tensor

Tested on: Euclidean, polar, sphere (K=1), torus (variable K), Poincaré disk (hyperbolic).

Numerical validation confirms K=1 for unit sphere.

**Title:** I built a Python class to compute metric tensors, Christoffel symbols, and Gaussian curvature - here's what I learned

**Body:**

Hey everyone! I've been diving into differential geometry and decided to implement the core concepts in Python.

**What's a metric tensor?**

Think of it as a generalization of the Pythagorean theorem. In flat space, distance is just ds² = dx² + dy². But on a curved surface like a sphere, the formula becomes:

ds² = g_μν dx^μ dx^ν

The metric tensor g_μν encodes how distances and angles work at every point.

**What I implemented:**

1. A `MetricTensor` class that computes:
   - Line elements (infinitesimal distances)
   - Vector norms and inner products
   - Angles between vectors
   - Area elements via √det(g)

2. Several standard metrics:
   - Euclidean (flat space)
   - Polar coordinates (still flat, but metric varies with r)
   - Sphere: ds² = R²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)
   - Torus: non-uniform curvature!
   - Poincaré disk (hyperbolic geometry)

3. Numerical computation of:
   - Christoffel symbols Γ^λ_μν (using finite differences)
   - Gaussian curvature K from the Riemann tensor

**Cool results:**

- Unit sphere gives K = 1.0000 (exactly as predicted!)
- Flat space in polar coordinates gives K ≈ 0 (numerical precision)
- The visualization shows how "unit circles" become ellipses in curved coordinates

**Why this matters:**

This is the mathematical foundation for General Relativity. Spacetime has a metric tensor, and gravity IS the curvature of that metric.

How do you measure distance on a curved surface like Earth?

Regular geometry doesn't work - the "straight line" between two cities curves around the globe!

The answer is the metric tensor: a mathematical tool that generalizes the Pythagorean theorem to ANY surface.

I created a Python notebook that visualizes how distances and angles work on spheres, donuts (tori), and even hyperbolic space (where parallel lines diverge forever).

Understanding the Metric Tensor: A Computational Approach

I recently completed a deep-dive into differential geometry, implementing the metric tensor from scratch in Python.

The metric tensor g_μν is fundamental to:
- Measuring distances on curved manifolds
- General Relativity (gravity = spacetime curvature)
- Computer graphics and mesh processing
- Machine learning on non-Euclidean data

Technical Implementation:

Built a MetricTensor class supporting:
- Line element computation: ds² = g_μν dx^μ dx^ν
- Inverse metric calculation
- Inner products and vector norms
- Numerical Christoffel symbols via finite differences
- Gaussian curvature from the Riemann tensor

Validated on multiple geometries:
- Sphere: K = 1/R² (constant positive curvature)
- Torus: Variable curvature (positive outside, negative inside)
- Poincaré disk: Constant negative curvature (hyperbolic)

Key insight: The visualization of metric ellipses across coordinate space reveals how local geometry varies - essential for understanding geodesics and parallel transport.

the geometry of curved spaces, visualized

each ellipse shows how distance works at that point - when they're stretched, space is "warped"

top left: polar coordinates (flat, but r matters)
top right: sphere (constant curvature everywhere)
bottom left: torus/donut (curvature varies!)
bottom right: hyperbolic space (distances explode near the edge)

this is the metric tensor in action
