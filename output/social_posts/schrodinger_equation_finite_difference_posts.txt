Just built a quantum mechanics solver from scratch using Python!

The Schrödinger equation Ĥψ = Eψ tells us how particles behave at tiny scales. By discretizing space into 500 points and approximating derivatives with finite differences, we can turn this into a matrix problem.

Result: Energy eigenvalues within 10⁻⁶ of exact values!

The wavefunctions show beautiful patterns—each excited state has exactly n nodes, just like theory predicts.

Numerical solution of the time-independent Schrödinger equation using finite differences.

The second derivative d²ψ/dx² is approximated as:
(ψᵢ₊₁ - 2ψᵢ + ψᵢ₋₁)/(Δx)²

This converts the eigenvalue problem Ĥψ = Eψ into a tridiagonal matrix system, efficiently solvable with scipy's eigh_tridiagonal.

For the harmonic oscillator V(x) = ½x², we recover Eₙ = n + ½ (atomic units) with excellent accuracy.

Convergence scales as O((Δx)²).

**Title:** I built a quantum mechanics solver in Python using finite differences - here's what I learned

**Body:**

Ever wondered how physicists actually solve the Schrödinger equation on a computer? I just implemented a solver and want to share what I learned!

**The Problem**

The time-independent Schrödinger equation looks like this:

-ℏ²/(2m) · d²ψ/dx² + V(x)ψ = Eψ

It tells us what energy levels (E) a quantum particle can have and what its wavefunction (ψ) looks like.

**The Trick: Turn Calculus into Linear Algebra**

The second derivative can be approximated as:
d²ψ/dx² ≈ (ψᵢ₊₁ - 2ψᵢ + ψᵢ₋₁)/(Δx)²

This turns the differential equation into a matrix eigenvalue problem Hψ = Eψ, where H is a tridiagonal matrix!

**Results**

For a harmonic oscillator potential V(x) = ½x², the exact energies are Eₙ = n + ½.

My numerical results:
- E₀ = 0.500000 (exact: 0.5)
- E₁ = 1.500000 (exact: 1.5)
- E₂ = 2.500000 (exact: 2.5)

Errors < 10⁻⁶ with just 500 grid points!

**Key Takeaways**

1. Quantum mechanics is computable with basic linear algebra
2. SciPy's eigh_tridiagonal is perfect for this
3. The n-th excited state has exactly n nodes
4. Accuracy improves as O((Δx)²)

Just solved one of quantum mechanics' most important equations using Python!

The Schrödinger equation describes how particles behave at atomic scales. By turning calculus into matrix math, we can compute exact energy levels that match textbook values to 6 decimal places.

The coolest part? Each wavefunction shows beautiful patterns—the ground state has no wiggles, while excited states have 1, 2, 3... nodes, exactly as quantum theory predicts!

Computational Quantum Mechanics: Solving the Schrödinger Equation with Finite Differences

I recently implemented a numerical solver for the time-independent Schrödinger equation, demonstrating how computational methods transform theoretical physics into practical calculations.

**Technical Approach:**

The continuous eigenvalue problem Ĥψ = Eψ is discretized using central finite differences, converting the second derivative into a tridiagonal matrix structure. This enables efficient computation using specialized algorithms (scipy.linalg.eigh_tridiagonal).

**Key Results:**

For the quantum harmonic oscillator benchmark:
- Computed energy eigenvalues accurate to 10⁻⁶
- Verified proper wavefunction orthonormality
- Demonstrated O((Δx)²) convergence scaling

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Numerical methods for differential equations
- Scientific Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)
- Quantum mechanics fundamentals
- Algorithm optimization for sparse matrices

This approach extends naturally to anharmonic potentials, periodic systems, and time-dependent problems.

Quantum mechanics, visualized.

These plots show solutions to the Schrödinger equation—the fundamental equation governing atoms and molecules.

Each colored line is a different energy state.
Each state has a specific number of "wiggles" (nodes).
The probability of finding the particle follows these wave patterns.

Built entirely in Python using 500 grid points and matrix algebra.

Sometimes the most profound physics can be captured with elegant code.
