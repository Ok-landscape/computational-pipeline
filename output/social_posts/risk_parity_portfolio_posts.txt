Risk Parity: Instead of equal capital, equalize RISK contributions across assets.

Result: Bonds get ~50% weight, Equities ~15%.

Why? Low-vol assets need more weight to contribute equal risk.

Implemented Risk Parity portfolio optimization in Python.

Key insight: Equal capital ≠ equal risk. A 25% allocation to Equities (18% vol) contributes way more risk than 25% to Bonds (5% vol).

Solution: Weight inversely to risk. Each asset contributes exactly 25% of portfolio risk.

Just built a Risk Parity portfolio optimizer and the results are fascinating.

Traditional portfolios allocate equal CAPITAL. Risk Parity allocates equal RISK.

The difference? Massive.

In my 4-asset portfolio:
- Equities: dropped from 25% → 15%
- Bonds: jumped from 25% → 51%

Why? Equities are 3.6× more volatile than Bonds. To contribute equal risk, you need way more Bonds.

The math: Total Risk Contribution = wᵢ × (Σw)ᵢ / σₚ

Each asset now contributes exactly 25% of portfolio risk. True diversification.

Implemented Bridgewater-style Risk Parity optimization in Python using scipy.optimize.

The objective function minimizes: Σᵢⱼ(TRCᵢ - TRCⱼ)²

Where TRCᵢ = wᵢ × (Σw)ᵢ / σₚ

Results for a 4-asset portfolio (Equities/Bonds/Commodities/Real Estate):

Risk Parity weights: 15.4% / 51.1% / 12.4% / 21.1%
vs Equal Weight: 25% each

Risk contributions: exactly 25% per asset (vs 36%/5%/41%/18% for equal-weight).

The massive bond overweight is the signature of risk parity.

**Title:** Built a Risk Parity Portfolio Optimizer - Here's What I Learned About "Equal Risk"

**Body:**

I just implemented a Risk Parity portfolio optimization from scratch in Python, and wanted to share what I learned.

**The Problem with Equal Weights**

If you split money equally across 4 assets (25% each), you're NOT splitting risk equally. Why? Volatility matters.

Example from my code:
- Equities: 18% volatility
- Bonds: 5% volatility
- Commodities: 22% volatility
- Real Estate: 14% volatility

With equal capital weights, Equities contribute 36% of portfolio risk while Bonds contribute only 5%. That's not diversified - you're basically just holding Equities with some decoration.

**The Risk Parity Solution**

Risk Parity equalizes risk contributions, not capital. The math:

Total Risk Contribution for asset i = wᵢ × (Σw)ᵢ / σₚ

Where:
- wᵢ = weight of asset i
- Σ = covariance matrix
- σₚ = portfolio volatility

We want TRCᵢ = TRCⱼ for all assets.

**My Results**

Risk Parity weights: Equities 15.4%, Bonds 51.1%, Commodities 12.4%, Real Estate 21.1%

Now each asset contributes exactly 25% of portfolio risk. That's true diversification.

**The Catch**

Risk Parity overweights low-return assets (Bonds). Expected return drops from 5.5% (equal weight) to 4.5%. In practice, funds like Bridgewater use leverage to boost returns while keeping the balanced risk profile.

**Code Highlights**

Used scipy.optimize.minimize with SLSQP method. The objective function is just the sum of squared differences in risk contributions.

Happy to answer questions about the implementation!

Ever wonder how Bridgewater (the world's largest hedge fund) builds portfolios?

They use Risk Parity - a strategy that equalizes RISK, not money.

I built one in Python. The surprising result: Bonds get 51% weight while Equities get only 15%.

Why? Equities are 3.6× more volatile. To contribute equal risk, you need way more of the calm stuff.

Each of my 4 assets now contributes exactly 25% of total portfolio risk. That's true diversification!

Implemented Risk Parity Portfolio Optimization: A Deep Dive into Risk-Based Allocation

Risk Parity represents a paradigm shift in portfolio construction - from capital allocation to risk allocation.

**The Core Insight**

Traditional equal-weight portfolios create unequal risk exposure. In a 4-asset portfolio (Equities, Bonds, Commodities, Real Estate), equal capital weights result in Equities contributing 36% of risk while Bonds contribute only 5%.

**The Methodology**

Risk Parity equalizes Total Risk Contribution (TRC) across all assets:

TRCᵢ = wᵢ × (Σw)ᵢ / σₚ

I implemented this using scipy.optimize with SLSQP, minimizing the sum of squared differences in risk contributions.

**Key Results**

- Risk Parity allocates: Equities 15.4%, Bonds 51.1%, Commodities 12.4%, Real Estate 21.1%
- Each asset contributes exactly 25% of portfolio risk
- Sharpe Ratio: 0.45 (vs 0.43 for equal-weight)

**Skills Demonstrated:** Python, NumPy, SciPy optimization, portfolio theory, financial mathematics, data visualization with Matplotlib.

Risk Parity Portfolio Optimization

Equal money ≠ Equal risk

Traditional portfolios put 25% in each asset.
But Equities (18% vol) contribute 7× more risk than Bonds (5% vol).

Risk Parity flips the script:
→ Weight assets by inverse volatility
→ Each asset contributes EQUAL risk

My results:
Equities: 25% → 15%
Bonds: 25% → 51%

The pie chart shows perfect 25% risk contribution from each asset.

This is how Bridgewater builds portfolios.
