Chaos from a simple equation! The Duffing oscillator: ẍ + δẋ + αx + βx³ = γcos(ωt)

A double-well potential creates unpredictable motion between two stable states.

The Duffing oscillator demonstrates how deterministic equations produce chaos.

With a double-well potential (α < 0, β > 0), the system hops unpredictably between stable points at x = ±1.

The strange attractor reveals order within chaos.

Ever wonder how simple physics can create unpredictable chaos?

The Duffing oscillator is a driven pendulum with a twist - its restoring force has a cubic term: ẍ + δẋ + αx + βx³ = γcos(ωt)

When you set α < 0 and β > 0, you get a double-well potential - like a ball rolling between two valleys. Add periodic forcing and the system goes chaotic!

The trajectory never repeats, yet it's bounded by a beautiful strange attractor. Deterministic but unpredictable.

Implemented the Duffing oscillator to explore chaotic dynamics.

Equation: ẍ + δẋ + αx + βx³ = γcos(ωt)

Parameters for chaos:
• δ = 0.3 (damping)
• α = -1.0 (negative → double-well)
• β = 1.0 (cubic stiffness)
• γ = 0.5 (driving amplitude)
• ω = 1.2 (driving frequency)

The Poincaré section reveals the strange attractor's structure - sampling at T = 2π/ω shows fractal geometry.

**Title:** [OC] Visualizing chaos with the Duffing Oscillator - Python simulation showing strange attractors

**Body:**

I created a Python notebook exploring the Duffing oscillator, a classic example of deterministic chaos.

**What is it?**

The Duffing equation describes a driven, damped oscillator with nonlinear stiffness:

ẍ + δẋ + αx + βx³ = γcos(ωt)

Think of it like a pendulum, but instead of a simple spring, you have a weird spring that gets stiffer (or softer) as you stretch it more.

**Why is it interesting?**

When you set α < 0 and β > 0, you create a "double-well potential" - imagine a ball that can rest in either of two valleys. Add periodic driving force and something magical happens: the ball hops between valleys in a completely unpredictable pattern!

This is chaos - the system is deterministic (same equations, same initial conditions → same result), but tiny changes in starting position lead to wildly different outcomes.

**What the plots show:**

1. **Time series** - The displacement never repeats the same pattern
2. **Phase portrait** - The strange attractor emerges as the trajectory traces a fractal pattern
3. **Poincaré section** - Sampling at the driving period reveals the attractor's structure
4. **Double-well potential** - The bistable energy landscape with minima at x = ±1

**Code:** Used scipy.integrate.solve_ivp with RK45 method. The notebook is self-contained with numpy, scipy, and matplotlib.

This system models real phenomena like buckled beams, ship rolling, and MEMS devices. Happy to answer questions about nonlinear dynamics!

How can a simple equation create complete unpredictability?

I simulated the Duffing oscillator - a system where a ball rolls between two valleys, pushed by a periodic force. Despite being completely deterministic, the motion becomes chaotic and never repeats!

The "strange attractor" in the phase portrait shows the hidden order within chaos - trajectories are bounded but infinitely complex.

This models real systems like ship rolling and vibrating beams.

Exploring Nonlinear Dynamics: The Duffing Oscillator

I developed a computational analysis of the Duffing oscillator, a foundational model in nonlinear dynamics that exhibits chaotic behavior.

**Technical Approach:**
• Implemented the driven, damped oscillator equation with cubic nonlinearity
• Used scipy's solve_ivp with adaptive Runge-Kutta (RK45) integration
• Generated multiple visualization perspectives: time series, phase portraits, and Poincaré sections

**Key Findings:**
The double-well potential configuration (α = -1, β = 1) with periodic forcing (γ = 0.5, ω = 1.2) produces a strange attractor - a bounded but non-repeating trajectory in phase space.

**Engineering Applications:**
This model applies to structural dynamics (buckled beams), naval architecture (ship roll motion), and MEMS device design.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
• Numerical methods for ODEs
• Dynamical systems analysis
• Scientific visualization with matplotlib
• Self-contained reproducible research

Chaos is beautiful.

This is the Duffing oscillator - a simple equation that creates infinite complexity.

A ball rolling between two valleys, pushed by a rhythmic force. It never settles, never repeats, but never escapes.

The swirling pattern is a "strange attractor" - order hidden within chaos.
