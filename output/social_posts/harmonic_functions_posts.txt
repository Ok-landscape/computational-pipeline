Explored harmonic functions today: twice-differentiable functions satisfying Laplace's equation (Δu = 0). Verified the mean value property and maximum principle computationally. Real/imaginary parts of analytic functions are harmonic—beautiful bridge between analysis and physics.

Today I dove into harmonic functions—the solutions to Δu = 0 where Δ is the Laplacian operator (∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y² = 0).

What's cool: any harmonic function has this "mean value property" where the value at a point equals the average over any circle around it. Also, they only hit max/min values at boundaries, never inside!

Real and imaginary parts of complex functions like z² and z³ are harmonic. Applied everywhere: heat, electricity, fluid flow.

Computational exploration of harmonic functions: solutions to Laplace's equation Δu = 0.

Key properties verified numerically:
• Mean value property: u(x₀,y₀) = (1/|∂Bᵣ|) ∫ u(s) ds
• Maximum principle: extrema occur only on boundary ∂Ω
• Connection to holomorphic functions via Cauchy-Riemann

Tested on u(x,y) = x² - y² = Re(z²) and u(x,y) = 2xy = Im(z²). Finite difference approximations show |Δu| < 10⁻¹⁵.

**Title:**
Computational study of harmonic functions: verifying Laplace's equation and the mean value property

**Body (for r/learnpython or r/math):**

I just finished exploring harmonic functions—a fundamental concept in mathematical physics that connects complex analysis, PDEs, and real-world phenomena like heat flow and electrostatics.

**What are harmonic functions?**

A function u(x,y) is harmonic if it satisfies Laplace's equation:

Δu = 0

where Δ is the Laplacian operator: ∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y² = 0

**What I learned:**

1. **Laplace's Equation Verification**: Used finite difference approximations to compute Δu numerically. For functions like u = x² - y² (the real part of z²), the Laplacian is essentially zero (< 10⁻¹⁵). For non-harmonic functions like u = x² + y² the Laplacian is non-zero.

2. **Mean Value Property**: This blew my mind—for any harmonic function, the value at a point equals the average value over ANY circle centered at that point! I verified this by sampling points on circles of varying radii and computing the average. Errors were on the order of 10⁻⁶.

3. **Maximum Principle**: Harmonic functions can only achieve their max and min on the boundary of a domain, never in the interior. I tested this on a circular domain and confirmed that max(interior) ≤ max(boundary) and min(interior) ≥ min(boundary).

4. **Connection to Complex Analysis**: The real and imaginary parts of any holomorphic (complex differentiable) function are harmonic. For example, if z = x + iy, then both Re(z²) = x² - y² and Im(z²) = 2xy are harmonic.

**Code highlights:**

- Implemented finite difference Laplacian using numpy roll
- Verified mean value property by sampling circular contours
- Created 3D surface plots and contour maps for visualization
- Tested multiple examples: z², z³, linear functions

The notebook includes full Python implementation with matplotlib 3D plots showing the beautiful structure of these functions.

Ever wonder how heat spreads through a material or how electric fields behave? The math behind it involves "harmonic functions"—solutions to Laplace's equation (Δu = 0).

I just explored these computationally and verified a mind-bending property: at any point, the function's value equals the average of all surrounding values on a circle! They also only reach extremes at boundaries, never inside.

Computed examples using Python and created beautiful 3D visualizations.

**Computational Exploration: Harmonic Functions and Laplace's Equation**

I recently completed a computational study of harmonic functions—a cornerstone of applied mathematics with applications in physics, engineering, and data science.

**Technical Overview:**

Harmonic functions satisfy Laplace's equation (Δu = 0), where Δ is the Laplacian operator (sum of second partial derivatives). These functions describe equilibrium states in physical systems: steady-state heat distribution, electrostatic potentials, and incompressible fluid flow.

**Methodology:**

• Implemented finite difference approximations to numerically compute the Laplacian
• Verified the mean value property: u(x₀,y₀) = average over ∂Bᵣ(x₀,y₀)
• Demonstrated the maximum principle: extrema occur only on domain boundaries
• Explored the connection to complex analysis via holomorphic functions

**Key Results:**

For test functions u = x² - y² and u = 2xy (real and imaginary parts of z²), numerical Laplacians were < 10⁻¹⁵, confirming harmonicity. Mean value property verified with errors < 10⁻⁶ across multiple test points and radii.

**Skills Applied:** Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib), numerical PDE methods, scientific visualization, mathematical rigor

Harmonic Functions: When Math Meets Physics ✨

These beautiful surfaces solve Laplace's equation:
Δu = 0

What makes them special?

→ The value at any point = the average around it
→ Max and min only happen at edges, never inside
→ Real/imaginary parts of complex functions like z² and z³

Applications: heat flow, electricity, fluid dynamics

The plots show:
• 3D surfaces
• Level curves (contour lines)
• Laplacian verification (nearly zero!)

Code: Python + NumPy + Matplotlib
Math: PDEs + Complex Analysis
