Taught an AI to navigate a maze using Q-Learning!

The agent learns: Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[r + γ·max Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]

Implemented Q-Learning from scratch in Python to solve a gridworld navigation problem.

Key insight: The agent learns action values Q(s,a) through temporal difference updates, balancing exploration (ε-greedy) with exploitation.

Result: 100% success rate after training.

Just built a Q-Learning agent that teaches itself to navigate a maze!

Here's the magic: the agent starts knowing nothing, then learns by trial and error. Each time it takes an action, it updates its knowledge using:

Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[reward + γ·max Q(next state) - Q(s,a)]

The ε-greedy policy helps it explore early on, then exploit what it learned.

After 1000 episodes of training: 100% success rate, optimal path every time.

Reinforcement learning is like watching a robot figure out a puzzle on its own!

Implemented tabular Q-Learning for gridworld navigation.

Algorithm details:
• Model-free, off-policy TD learning
• Update rule: Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[r + γ·max_a' Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]
• ε-greedy exploration with decay (1.0 → 0.01)
• Hyperparams: α=0.1, γ=0.99

Results after 1000 episodes:
• 100% goal-reaching success rate
• Optimal 8-step path discovered
• TD error converged to near-zero

The Bellman optimality equation in action: Q*(s,a) = E[r + γ·max Q*(s',a')]

**Title:** I implemented Q-Learning from scratch to solve a gridworld maze - here's what I learned about RL fundamentals

**Body:**

I built a tabular Q-Learning agent in Python that learns to navigate from start to goal in a 5x5 gridworld with walls and traps. Wanted to share my implementation and key takeaways.

**The Core Idea**

Q-Learning finds the optimal action-value function Q*(s,a) without needing a model of the environment. The agent learns by interacting with the world and updating its Q-table using temporal difference (TD) learning:

Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[r + γ·max Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]

Where:
- α (0.1) = learning rate
- γ (0.99) = discount factor
- r = immediate reward
- max Q(s',a') = best estimated future value

**Exploration vs Exploitation**

Used ε-greedy policy starting at ε=1.0 (100% random) decaying to 0.01. This lets the agent explore early, then exploit learned knowledge.

**Results**

After 1000 training episodes:
- 100% success rate reaching the goal
- Optimal path found (8 steps)
- Average reward improved from negative to ~92

**Key Takeaways**

1. The discount factor γ determines how "far-sighted" the agent is
2. Sufficient exploration is critical - without it, the agent gets stuck in local optima
3. Watching TD error converge is satisfying - it shows the Q-values stabilizing

The code includes visualizations of the learning curve, policy arrows, Q-value heatmap, and TD error convergence.

Taught an AI to solve a maze using reinforcement learning!

The Q-Learning algorithm is fascinating - the agent starts with zero knowledge, then learns through trial and error. Each time it moves, it updates its "memory" of how good each action is in each position.

After 1000 practice runs, it achieved 100% success rate and found the optimal 8-step path every time.

It's like watching a robot figure out a puzzle completely on its own!

Reinforcement Learning Implementation: Q-Learning for Gridworld Navigation

I recently implemented a tabular Q-Learning agent from scratch in Python, demonstrating fundamental RL concepts through a gridworld navigation task.

**Technical Approach:**
- Model-free, off-policy temporal difference learning
- ε-greedy exploration strategy with exponential decay
- Bellman optimality equation: Q*(s,a) = E[r + γ·max Q*(s',a')]

**Hyperparameters:**
- Learning rate (α): 0.1
- Discount factor (γ): 0.99
- Exploration decay: 0.995 per episode

**Results:**
- 100% goal-reaching success rate after 1000 episodes
- Optimal policy discovered (8-step path)
- Clear TD error convergence demonstrating algorithm stability

**Key Skills Demonstrated:**
- Reinforcement learning algorithm implementation
- NumPy for efficient array operations
- Matplotlib for comprehensive result visualization
- Understanding of exploration-exploitation tradeoffs

This project reinforces why understanding foundational algorithms matters - modern Deep RL builds directly on these principles.

Teaching an AI to solve mazes

Built a Q-Learning agent that learns purely through trial and error.

The magic formula:
Q(state, action) updates based on:
reward + future value estimate

Starting point: completely random
After 1000 episodes: 100% success rate

The visualization shows:
- Learning curve (rewards over time)
- Optimal policy (arrows showing best moves)
- Q-value heatmap (state importance)
- Exploration decay (random → strategic)

Reinforcement learning is how we teach machines to make decisions.
