Julius Caesar's secret code: shift each letter by k positions.

Encryption: E(p) = (p + k) mod 26
Decryption: D(c) = (c - k) mod 26

Built a Python cryptanalysis tool that breaks it using frequency analysis!

### Bluesky (300 chars max)

Implemented the Caesar cipher in Python - one of history's oldest encryption methods.

The math is elegant:
E(p) = (p + k) mod 26

But with only 26 possible keys, it's trivially broken by frequency analysis. My code recovers the secret key by comparing letter distributions to English.

Ever wonder how Julius Caesar kept his messages secret?

He used a simple substitution cipher - shift every letter by a fixed amount. A becomes D, B becomes E, and so on.

The math: E(p) = (p + k) mod 26

I built a complete Python implementation with:
- Encryption/decryption functions
- Frequency analysis attack
- Chi-squared statistical test

The coolest part? With enough ciphertext, the code automatically recovers the secret key by matching letter frequencies to English patterns.

New notebook: Caesar Cipher Implementation & Cryptanalysis

Mathematical formulation:
- Encryption: E_k(p) = (p + k) mod 26
- Decryption: D_k(c) = (c - k) mod 26

Key space |K| = 26 (trivially small!)

Implemented frequency analysis attack using chi-squared statistic:
χ² = Σ (O_i - E_i)² / E_i

The cipher preserves statistical properties of plaintext, making it vulnerable to comparing ciphertext frequencies against known English letter distributions.

**Title:** I implemented the Caesar cipher in Python with automatic cryptanalysis - here's how frequency analysis breaks ancient encryption

**Body:**

I've been exploring classical cryptography and just finished a complete Python implementation of the Caesar cipher, including a tool that automatically breaks it.

**The Basics**

The Caesar cipher (named after Julius Caesar) shifts each letter by a fixed amount. If your key is 3:
- A → D
- B → E
- HELLO → KHOOR

Mathematically: E(p) = (p + k) mod 26

**Why It's Insecure**

Two major vulnerabilities:

1. **Tiny key space** - Only 26 possible keys means brute force takes microseconds
2. **Frequency preservation** - The statistical distribution of letters is preserved

**The Cool Part: Automatic Cryptanalysis**

I implemented a frequency analysis attack that:
- Tries all 26 possible keys
- Computes letter frequencies for each decryption attempt
- Uses chi-squared test to compare against expected English frequencies
- Returns the key with the best statistical match

With enough ciphertext (a paragraph or more), it reliably recovers the key without any human intervention.

**What I Learned**

- Modular arithmetic is fundamental to cryptography
- Statistical attacks exploit patterns that encryption fails to hide
- This is why modern ciphers (AES, etc.) are designed to be statistically indistinguishable from random noise

The notebook includes visualizations of the encryption mapping, letter frequency distributions, and chi-squared scores for all candidate keys.

Happy to answer questions about the implementation or cryptanalysis techniques!

Ever wonder how ancient generals kept their battle plans secret?

Julius Caesar used a clever trick: shift every letter in the message by the same amount. A becomes D, B becomes E, and so on. To decode it, just shift back!

I built a Python program that not only encrypts/decrypts messages this way, but also BREAKS the code automatically by analyzing letter patterns. In English, E is the most common letter (~13%), so the program looks for that pattern in the scrambled text.

It's a fun introduction to cryptography!

Exploring Classical Cryptography: Caesar Cipher Implementation

I recently completed a computational notebook implementing the Caesar cipher - one of history's earliest encryption methods - along with automated cryptanalysis tools that demonstrate why it's insecure.

Key Technical Components:

- Encryption/Decryption: Implemented using modular arithmetic, E(p) = (p + k) mod 26
- Frequency Analysis: Statistical attack comparing ciphertext letter distributions to expected English frequencies
- Chi-Squared Testing: Quantitative method to identify the most likely decryption key

The project demonstrates fundamental cryptographic concepts:
- Symmetric key encryption
- The importance of key space size (26 keys = trivially breakable)
- Statistical cryptanalysis techniques
- Why modern ciphers must achieve statistical indistinguishability

Skills Applied: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, statistical analysis, algorithm design

While the Caesar cipher is trivially broken by modern standards, understanding its weaknesses provides essential intuition for studying secure systems like AES and RSA.

Ancient encryption meets modern code-breaking

This visualization shows how the Caesar cipher works - and why it fails.

Top left: How letters map during encryption (shift by 3)
Top right: English letter frequencies (E is most common at ~13%)
Bottom left: Ciphertext frequencies match shifted English pattern
Bottom right: Chi-squared test identifies the secret key (red bar)

Julius Caesar thought this was unbreakable.
My Python script cracks it in milliseconds.

The lesson? Good encryption must hide statistical patterns, not just scramble letters.
