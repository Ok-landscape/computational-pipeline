Exploring the foundations of abstract algebra: groups, rings, and fields.

Implemented cyclic groups Zn and finite fields Fp in Python - verified closure, associativity, identity, and inverse properties programmatically.

Ever wondered what mathematicians mean by "algebraic structures"?

Just built a Python exploration of the three fundamental ones:

- Groups: sets with one operation (like clock arithmetic!)
- Rings: sets with addition AND multiplication
- Fields: rings where you can divide (except by zero)

The coolest part? Cayley tables - visual grids showing every possible operation result. They reveal hidden symmetries instantly!

Also verified Lagrange's theorem: subgroup sizes always divide the group size. Math is wild.

Deep dive into algebraic structures with Python!

Implemented:
- CyclicGroup class for Zn with axiom verification
- FiniteField class for Fp using Fermat's little theorem for inverses: a^(-1) = a^(p-2) mod p
- PolynomialRing over finite fields
- SymmetricGroup S_n with parity computation

Key insight: Cayley tables are Latin squares (each element appears once per row/column) - a visual proof of the group structure!

Verified group homomorphism Z6 -> Z2 and found ker(phi) = {0,2,4}.

**Title:** I built a Python toolkit to explore Groups, Rings, and Fields - visualizing abstract algebra with Cayley tables

**Body:**

Hey everyone! I created an interactive Jupyter notebook exploring the three fundamental algebraic structures that underpin modern mathematics.

**What are these structures?**

- **Groups (G, *)** - A set with one operation satisfying: closure, associativity, identity element, and inverses. Example: integers mod n under addition (Zn)

- **Rings (R, +, x)** - Two operations where (R, +) is an abelian group, multiplication is associative, and distribution holds. Example: integers Z

- **Fields (F, +, x)** - A ring where every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse. Example: integers mod p for prime p (Fp)

**What I implemented:**

1. `CyclicGroup` class - computes Cayley tables, verifies all four group axioms programmatically
2. `FiniteField` class - uses Fermat's little theorem (a^(-1) = a^(p-2) mod p) for multiplicative inverses
3. `PolynomialRing` class - arithmetic over finite fields
4. `SymmetricGroup` class - permutation composition, parity, and alternating groups

**Cool discoveries:**

- Cayley tables are always Latin squares - each element appears exactly once per row/column. This is a visual proof that groups have unique solutions!
- Verified Lagrange's theorem: subgroup orders always divide group order
- Group homomorphism from Z6 to Z2 has kernel {0, 2, 4}

The visualization shows Cayley tables for Z5, Z6, and both operations in F5. The patterns are hypnotic!

Just finished a deep dive into the foundations of abstract algebra!

Groups, rings, and fields are the building blocks that mathematicians use to study everything from cryptography to physics.

I built Python classes to explore these structures and created colorful visualizations of their "Cayley tables" - grids that show every possible operation result.

The patterns that emerge are beautiful - math really is an art!

Exploring Abstract Algebra Through Computational Methods

I recently completed a computational exploration of fundamental algebraic structures - groups, rings, and fields - the mathematical foundations underlying cryptography, coding theory, and modern physics.

Key implementations:
- Cyclic group Zn with automated axiom verification (closure, associativity, identity, inverse)
- Finite field Fp using Fermat's Little Theorem for efficient inverse computation
- Polynomial ring arithmetic over finite fields
- Symmetric group Sn with permutation parity analysis

Technical highlights:
- Verified group homomorphisms programmatically and computed kernels
- Demonstrated Lagrange's theorem across subgroup lattices
- Generated Cayley table visualizations revealing Latin square structure

This project reinforces how computational tools can make abstract mathematical concepts concrete and verifiable. The same finite field arithmetic powers RSA encryption and error-correcting codes used in everyday communications.

The mathematics behind encryption, physics, and coding theory - all in one notebook!

Groups. Rings. Fields.

These algebraic structures are everywhere:
- RSA encryption? Finite fields
- Quantum mechanics? Symmetry groups
- Error correction? Polynomial rings

Swipe to see Cayley tables - beautiful grids showing every operation in these mathematical universes.

Each row and column contains every element exactly once. Patterns within patterns.
