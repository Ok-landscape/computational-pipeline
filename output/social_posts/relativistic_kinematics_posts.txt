Why does time slow down at high speeds? The Lorentz factor γ = 1/√(1-v²/c²) explains it all! At 99.94% of c, muons live 29x longer than at rest.

Visualized the math with Python.

Explored relativistic kinematics in Python today. The Lorentz factor γ = 1/√(1-β²) is the key to understanding why moving clocks run slow and rulers shrink.

At β = 0.9, relativistic momentum is 2.3x the classical prediction. Einstein was onto something big.

Ever wonder why nothing can travel faster than light?

I built a Python notebook exploring relativistic kinematics - the physics of objects moving near light speed.

The magic is in the Lorentz factor: γ = 1/√(1-v²/c²)

This single formula explains:
• Time dilation (moving clocks run slow)
• Length contraction (moving objects shrink)
• Why momentum → ∞ as v → c

My favorite result: Add 0.6c + 0.7c using Einstein's formula and you get 0.915c, not 1.3c!

The universe has a built-in speed limit.

New computational notebook: Relativistic Kinematics

Implemented the core equations of special relativity in Python:

• Lorentz factor: γ = 1/√(1-β²)
• Time dilation: Δt = γΔt₀
• Length contraction: L = L₀/γ
• Energy-momentum: E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²

Key verification: At β = 0.8, the energy E = γm₀c² = 1.6667m₀c² matches √(p² + m₀²) exactly.

Also demonstrated relativistic velocity addition: 0.6c ⊕ 0.7c = 0.915c

The math is beautiful. #Physics #Python #Relativity #Science

**Title:** I built a Python notebook visualizing relativistic kinematics - here's what I learned about Einstein's physics

**Body:**

I wanted to understand special relativity beyond just the equations, so I coded up the key relationships in Python and visualized them.

**The Core Idea**

Everything in relativistic kinematics comes from one formula - the Lorentz factor:

γ = 1/√(1 - v²/c²)

where β = v/c is your speed as a fraction of light speed.

**What happens at high speeds:**

1. **Time dilation** - A clock moving at 0.9994c (like cosmic ray muons) experiences time 29x slower. That's why muons created in the upper atmosphere survive long enough to reach Earth's surface.

2. **Length contraction** - Objects shrink along their direction of motion by factor 1/γ

3. **Momentum goes wild** - At β = 0.9, relativistic momentum p = γm₀v is 2.29x the classical prediction. As v → c, momentum → ∞, which is why you can't accelerate to light speed.

4. **Velocity addition** - Add 0.6c + 0.7c and you don't get 1.3c. Einstein's formula gives (0.6 + 0.7)/(1 + 0.6×0.7) = 0.915c. The universe enforces its speed limit!

**The energy-momentum relation**

The most elegant equation: E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²

For massless particles (photons), this gives E = pc. For massive particles at rest, E = m₀c² (that famous equation!).

**Code highlights:**

- Used numpy for vectorized calculations
- Created 6 publication-quality plots with matplotlib
- Verified the energy-momentum relation numerically

The full notebook is available here:

What aspects of special relativity would you like to see explored next? I'm thinking about relativistic Doppler effect or maybe the twin paradox with actual numbers.

Did you know that time literally runs slower when you move fast?

I created a computational notebook exploring relativistic kinematics - the physics of near-light-speed motion.

The key formula is γ = 1/√(1-v²/c²)

At 99.94% of light speed, time slows by a factor of 29! This isn't science fiction - it's how GPS satellites work and why particle accelerators can study short-lived particles.

Computational Physics Project: Relativistic Kinematics

I recently completed a Python notebook implementing the core equations of Einstein's Special Relativity, demonstrating both the mathematical framework and practical numerical verification.

Key implementations:
• Lorentz factor calculations: γ = 1/√(1-β²)
• Time dilation and length contraction
• Relativistic vs. classical momentum/energy comparisons
• Energy-momentum dispersion relation: E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²
• Relativistic velocity addition formula

Technical approach:
- NumPy for vectorized mathematical operations
- Matplotlib with GridSpec for multi-panel publication-quality visualizations
- Numerical verification of theoretical predictions

Notable result: Demonstrated that at β = 0.8, the independently calculated energy E = γm₀c² = 1.6667m₀c² precisely matches the energy-momentum relation √(p² + m₀²), validating the implementation.

This type of computational verification is essential in physics education and research - it builds intuition while ensuring mathematical consistency.

The physics of near-light-speed motion

This visualization shows 6 key relationships in special relativity:

• The Lorentz factor γ → ∞ as v → c
• Time slows down for moving observers
• Objects shrink along their motion
• Momentum diverges from classical predictions
• Energy-momentum relation E² = p²c² + m₀²c⁴
• Velocity addition respects the cosmic speed limit

My favorite: At 0.9994c, muons live 29x longer due to time dilation. That's why cosmic ray muons reach Earth's surface!

Built with Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
