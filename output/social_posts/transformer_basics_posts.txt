### 3. Threads (< 500 chars)

Ever wonder how ChatGPT processes text?

It all comes down to one equation:
Attention = softmax(QKᵀ/√dₖ)V

Just implemented a Transformer encoder from scratch:
• Scaled dot-product attention
• Multi-head attention (4 heads attending to different patterns)
• Sinusoidal positional encodings
• Layer normalization

The scaling factor √dₖ is crucial - without it, softmax saturates and gradients vanish.

Simple math, revolutionary results.

### 4. Mastodon (< 500 chars)

Implemented the Transformer architecture from Vaswani et al. (2017) in pure NumPy.

Key components:
• Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QKᵀ/√dₖ)V
• Multi-head: Concat(head₁,...,headₕ)Wᴼ
• Positional encoding: PE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/10000^(2i/d))

The √dₖ scaling normalizes variance from dₖ to 1, preventing softmax saturation.

Visualization shows how different heads learn distinct attention patterns.

**Title:** Implemented Transformer Attention from Scratch - Here's What I Learned

**Body:**

I just built a complete Transformer encoder layer in pure NumPy to really understand what's happening under the hood.

**The Core Idea (ELI5):**

Imagine you're reading a sentence and trying to understand one word. Attention lets each word "look at" every other word and decide how much to pay attention to it. The word "it" might pay lots of attention to "cat" earlier in the sentence to figure out what "it" refers to.

**The Math:**

Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QKᵀ/√dₖ)V

• Q (Query): "What am I looking for?"
• K (Key): "What do I contain?"
• V (Value): "What information do I provide?"

**Why divide by √dₖ?**

This was my "aha" moment. When dₖ is large, dot products have high variance (specifically, Var(q·k) = dₖ). Large values push softmax into saturation where gradients nearly vanish. Dividing by √dₖ normalizes variance to 1.

**Multi-Head Attention:**

Instead of one attention function, we run several in parallel. Each "head" can focus on different aspects - one might track syntax, another semantics.

MultiHead = Concat(head₁,...,headₕ)Wᴼ

**Positional Encoding:**

Since there's no recurrence, we inject position info using sinusoids:

PE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/10000^(2i/d))
PE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/10000^(2i/d))

The wavelengths form a geometric progression, allowing the model to learn relative positions.

**What I Built:**

• Scaled dot-product attention
• Multi-head attention with 4 heads
• Positional encoding generator
• Layer normalization
• Feed-forward network
• Complete encoder layer with residuals

The visualizations show how different heads develop distinct attention patterns, and how causal masking works for decoder self-attention.

### 6. Facebook (< 500 chars)

Ever wondered how AI models like ChatGPT understand language?

It's all based on "attention" - a mechanism that lets each word look at every other word and decide what's relevant.

The core equation is beautifully simple:
Attention = softmax(QKᵀ/√dₖ)V

I implemented a complete Transformer encoder from scratch to understand how it works. The visualizations show how different "attention heads" focus on different patterns in the input.

**Understanding Transformers: A First-Principles Implementation**

I recently completed a from-scratch implementation of the Transformer encoder architecture, the foundation of modern NLP models including GPT and BERT.

**Technical Implementation:**

• Scaled dot-product attention: Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QKᵀ/√dₖ)V
• Multi-head attention with parallel attention functions
• Sinusoidal positional encodings for sequence order
• Layer normalization with residual connections
• Position-wise feed-forward networks

**Key Insight:**

The scaling factor 1/√dₖ is crucial for training stability. Without it, large dot products cause softmax saturation, leading to vanishing gradients. This normalizes the variance from dₖ to 1.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

• Linear algebra and matrix operations
• NumPy for scientific computing
• Deep learning architecture design
• Mathematical reasoning about gradient flow
• Data visualization with Matplotlib

Building foundational architectures from scratch provides deeper intuition than using pre-built libraries alone.
