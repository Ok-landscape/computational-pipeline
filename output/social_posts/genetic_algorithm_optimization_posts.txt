### Bluesky (300 chars)

Implemented a Genetic Algorithm for continuous optimization on the Rastrigin function - notorious for its many local minima.

Tournament selection + arithmetic crossover + Gaussian mutation = convergence to global optimum x* = 0.

Nature-inspired computing at its finest.

Just implemented a Genetic Algorithm from scratch and it's fascinating how well biological evolution translates to math!

The setup:
- Population of candidate solutions
- Selection: fitter individuals reproduce more
- Crossover: combine parent "genes"
- Mutation: random changes for diversity

Tested on the Rastrigin function (a nightmare with 100+ local minima), and the GA found the global minimum at x = 0.

The convergence plot shows rapid early improvement followed by gradual refinement - just like real evolution!

Genetic Algorithm implementation for continuous optimization.

Target: Rastrigin function f(x) = 10n + Σᵢ[xᵢ² - 10cos(2πxᵢ)]

This function has ~10ⁿ local minima, making gradient descent useless.

GA operators used:
- Tournament selection (k=3)
- Arithmetic crossover: x_child = αx_a + (1-α)x_b
- Gaussian mutation: x' = x + N(0, σ²)

Result: Found global optimum x* ≈ [0, 0] with f(x*) ≈ 0

Complexity: O(G·N·n·k) for G generations

**Title:** Implemented a Genetic Algorithm to Optimize the Rastrigin Function - Here's How Evolution Solves Hard Math Problems

**Body:**

I built a Genetic Algorithm (GA) in Python to tackle the Rastrigin function, a classic optimization benchmark that trips up gradient-based methods.

**ELI5: What's a Genetic Algorithm?**

Imagine you're trying to find the lowest point in a mountain range while blindfolded. Instead of walking downhill (gradient descent), you:

1. Drop 100 random hikers (population)
2. The ones at lower elevations get to "reproduce" more
3. Their children inherit mixed traits from both parents (crossover)
4. Some kids randomly wander a bit (mutation)
5. Repeat for many generations

Over time, the population clusters around the lowest valley - even if there are tons of fake valleys (local minima).

**Why the Rastrigin Function?**

f(x) = 10n + Σᵢ[xᵢ² - 10cos(2πxᵢ)]

This function has approximately 10ⁿ local minima! For just 2 dimensions, that's ~100 places where gradient descent would get stuck. The global minimum is at x = [0, 0] with f(x) = 0.

**Key Implementation Details:**

- Tournament selection (pick best from k random individuals)
- Arithmetic crossover: child = α·parent1 + (1-α)·parent2
- Gaussian mutation: x' = x + N(0, σ²)
- Elitism: keep the 2 best solutions each generation

**Results:**

After 150 generations with 100 individuals, the algorithm found x ≈ [0, 0] with fitness ≈ 0. The convergence plot shows exponential improvement early on, then gradual refinement.

**What I Learned:**

- Mutation rate is crucial: too high = random search, too low = premature convergence
- Tournament size controls selection pressure
- Elitism prevents losing good solutions but can reduce diversity

Ever wondered how computers can "evolve" solutions to hard problems?

I implemented a Genetic Algorithm - a technique inspired by natural selection - to solve an optimization problem with over 100 local minima.

The algorithm mimics evolution: create a population of solutions, let the best ones reproduce, mix their traits, add random mutations, and repeat. After 150 generations, it found the global optimum!

Implemented a Genetic Algorithm for Continuous Optimization

Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are powerful metaheuristic optimization techniques that excel where gradient-based methods fail - particularly in multimodal landscapes with numerous local optima.

Key Implementation Components:

• Population-based search with tournament selection
• Arithmetic crossover for solution recombination
• Gaussian mutation for maintaining diversity
• Elitism to preserve high-quality solutions

Benchmark: The Rastrigin function, which has ~10ⁿ local minima, making it a rigorous test for any optimizer. The GA successfully converged to the global optimum at x* = [0, 0].

Technical Insights:

Parameter sensitivity analysis reveals the exploration-exploitation tradeoff: higher mutation rates maintain diversity but slow convergence, while larger tournament sizes increase selection pressure.

Computational complexity scales as O(G·N·n·k) for G generations, N population size, n dimensions, and k tournament size.

Skills demonstrated: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, optimization algorithms, scientific visualization, evolutionary computation.

Evolution meets mathematics

This visualization shows a Genetic Algorithm solving a deceptively hard problem - finding the lowest point on a surface with 100+ fake valleys.

The algorithm:
→ Creates a population of random guesses
→ Selects the best performers
→ Combines their "DNA" through crossover
→ Adds mutations for diversity
→ Repeats for 150 generations

The red trajectory shows how the solution evolved from random starting point to global optimum.

No gradients needed - just survival of the fittest!
