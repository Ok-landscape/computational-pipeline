Why do casinos always win? The math of Gambler's Ruin shows even a tiny house edge leads to inevitable bankruptcy. With p=0.4, your success odds drop dramatically!

Explored the Gambler's Ruin problem: a classic probability puzzle showing why persistent gambling leads to ruin.

Key insight: In a fair game (p=0.5), success probability = i/N (your starting fraction of the target).

Even slight disadvantages compound exponentially.

Ever wonder why the house always wins?

I built a simulation of the Gambler's Ruin problem - you start with i dollars, trying to reach N dollars. Each round you win or lose $1.

The surprising math: Even in a "fair" game where p=0.5, your chance of winning is just i/N. Start with $10, aiming for $20? That's only 50% success.

But add a tiny house edge (p=0.4) and watch those odds plummet! The difference equation P_i = p*P_{i+1} + q*P_{i-1} reveals the brutal truth.

Random walks are fascinating!

Implemented the Gambler's Ruin problem with Monte Carlo simulation and analytical solutions.

The probability of success starting from fortune i with target N:
- Fair game: P_i = i/N
- Biased: P_i = (1-(q/p)^i)/(1-(q/p)^N)

Expected duration for p=0.5: D_i = i(N-i), forming a parabola maximized at N/2.

Verified with 10,000 simulations - theoretical and empirical results match beautifully.

Applications: population genetics, financial risk, ruin theory.

**Title:** I simulated the Gambler's Ruin problem - here's why casinos always win

**Body:**

Hey everyone! I just completed a Python notebook exploring one of probability theory's most elegant problems: Gambler's Ruin.

**The Setup:**
You have i dollars and want to reach N dollars. Each round, you win $1 with probability p, or lose $1 with probability q=1-p. Game ends when you hit $0 (ruin) or $N (success).

**The Math (simplified):**
The probability of success follows a recurrence relation:
P_i = p*P_{i+1} + q*P_{i-1}

For a fair game (p=0.5), this solves to: P_i = i/N

So if you start with $10 aiming for $20, you have exactly 50% chance. Seems reasonable, right?

But here's the kicker - for a biased game (p=0.4):
P_i = (1-(q/p)^i)/(1-(q/p)^N)

That same $10 to $20 scenario? Your odds drop to about 1.7%!

**What I learned:**
1. Even tiny house edges compound devastatingly
2. Expected game duration follows D_i = i(N-i) for fair games - it's a parabola!
3. Monte Carlo simulations beautifully confirm the analytical solutions

The notebook includes full Python code with numpy/matplotlib, comparing analytical formulas vs 10,000 simulated random walks.

Ever wondered why casinos always win in the long run?

I explored the "Gambler's Ruin" problem - a beautiful piece of probability theory that explains it all.

Starting with $10 and trying to double it sounds like 50/50 odds, right? In a fair game, yes! But add just a 10% house edge and your chances drop to under 2%.

The math shows that against an opponent with unlimited resources, eventual ruin is essentially guaranteed.

Probability Theory in Action: The Gambler's Ruin Problem

I recently completed an analytical and computational study of the classic Gambler's Ruin problem, demonstrating the intersection of mathematical theory and Monte Carlo simulation.

Key Technical Highlights:

- Derived closed-form solutions for success probability: P_i = (1-(q/p)^i)/(1-(q/p)^N) for biased games
- Implemented efficient Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 iterations
- Validated theoretical predictions against empirical results with strong convergence

The expected duration formula D_i = i(N-i) for fair games reveals optimal stopping characteristics - maximum uncertainty occurs at N/2.

This problem has direct applications in:
- Financial risk management and ruin theory
- Population genetics (fixation probabilities)
- Insurance mathematics
- Algorithm analysis (random walks)

The project demonstrates skills in: Python (NumPy, Matplotlib), stochastic processes, numerical validation, and scientific visualization.

The Math Behind Why Casinos Always Win

This visualization shows the Gambler's Ruin problem - one of probability's most elegant results.

Top left: How starting money affects your odds
Top right: Expected game length (parabolic!)
Bottom left: Random walk trajectories
Bottom right: The devastating effect of house edge

The key insight?

In a fair game: odds = start/goal
With 10% house edge: odds collapse to ~2%

Even tiny disadvantages compound into certain ruin over time.
