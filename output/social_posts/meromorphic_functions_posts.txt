Ever wonder what functions look like when they "blow up" at specific points? 🌀

Meromorphic functions are like smooth roads with infinite speed bumps—analytic everywhere except at isolated poles!

Meromorphic functions: complex functions that are analytic everywhere except at isolated poles where they shoot to ∞.

Computed residues, visualized the Gamma function Γ(z), and created phase portraits showing pole structure in the complex plane.

A beautiful blend of theory and computation.

================================

Just explored meromorphic functions—basically complex functions that are smooth everywhere except at a few "trouble spots" (poles) where they explode to infinity!

Think of tan(z) with its infinite poles at π/2 + nπ, or the famous Gamma function Γ(z) with poles at all negative integers.

The coolest part? The residue theorem lets you calculate complex integrals just by checking what happens near the poles. Verified it numerically and the math checks out! ✨

Deep dive into meromorphic functions: complex functions holomorphic everywhere except at isolated poles.

Key examples computed:
• Γ(z): simple poles at z = 0, -1, -2, ...
• tan(z): infinitely many poles at z = π/2 + nπ
• f(z) = z²/[(z-1)(z-2)(z+i)]: verified residue theorem numerically

Generated phase portraits showing pole structure—poles appear where all colors meet due to rapid phase winding.

TITLE: Visualizing Meromorphic Functions: From Gamma to Phase Portraits [OC]

BODY:

I just finished a computational exploration of meromorphic functions and wanted to share what I learned!

## What are Meromorphic Functions?

A meromorphic function is a complex function f(z) that's analytic (smooth) everywhere except at a discrete set of isolated points called **poles**, where the function blows up to infinity.

The name comes from Greek: "meros" (part) + "morphe" (form) = "partially holomorphic"

## Examples I Explored

**1. The Gamma Function Γ(z)**
- Generalizes the factorial: Γ(n+1) = n! for integers
- Has simple poles at z = 0, -1, -2, -3, ...
- The residues follow a beautiful pattern: Res(Γ, -n) = (-1)ⁿ/n!

**2. Simple Rational Functions**
- f(z) = 1/(z² + 1) has poles at z = ±i
- Computed residues: Res(f, i) = 1/(2i), Res(f, -i) = -1/(2i)

**3. The Tangent Function**
- tan(z) = sin(z)/cos(z) has infinitely many poles
- Located at z = π/2 + nπ for all integers n
- Each pole has residue -1

## The Residue Theorem

This is the killer app for meromorphic functions! For a closed contour γ enclosing poles {z_k}:

∮_γ f(z) dz = 2πi ∑_k Res(f, z_k)

I verified this numerically for f(z) = z²/[(z-1)(z-2)(z+i)] by:
1. Computing residues analytically
2. Numerically integrating around a contour
3. Comparing the results—they matched to within 10⁻⁹!

## Phase Portraits

The coolest visualization: phase portraits where hue = arg(f(z)) and brightness = |f(z)|.

Poles appear as points where all colors meet (because the phase winds rapidly around them). You can literally *see* the complex structure!

## What I Learned

- Meromorphic functions generalize rational functions to infinite cases
- The residue at a pole captures local behavior via Laurent series
- Numerical verification of the residue theorem builds intuition
- Phase portraits reveal structure invisible in traditional plots
- Tools: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib for all computations

The interplay between analytical formulas and computational verification was incredibly satisfying. Complex analysis comes alive when you can actually *see* these functions!

Ever heard of functions that are smooth everywhere except at specific "blow-up" points? That's meromorphic functions!

Just computed and visualized some famous examples:
✨ The Gamma function Γ(z)—a generalization of factorials
✨ tan(z) with its infinite poles
✨ Phase portraits showing where complex functions explode to infinity

The math behind this powers everything from quantum physics to evaluating tricky integrals. Science is beautiful! 🌀

7. LINKEDIN (< 1000 chars)
================================

Just completed a computational analysis of meromorphic functions—a fundamental class of complex functions that appear throughout mathematics, physics, and engineering.

**Technical Highlights:**

Meromorphic functions are complex-valued functions that are holomorphic everywhere except at isolated poles (points where the function diverges to infinity). They form a natural generalization of rational functions.

**Key Examples Analyzed:**

1. **Gamma Function Γ(z):** Computed pole locations at negative integers and verified the residue formula Res(Γ, -n) = (-1)ⁿ/n!

2. **Residue Theorem Verification:** For f(z) = z²/[(z-1)(z-2)(z+i)], calculated residues analytically and validated via numerical contour integration (agreement to 10⁻⁹)

3. **Phase Portrait Visualization:** Generated complex phase plots where hue encodes arg(f(z)) and brightness encodes |f(z)|—poles appear as color singularities

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Complex analysis theory and Laurent series
- Numerical integration using SciPy
- Scientific visualization with Matplotlib
- Verification of analytical results through computation

**Applications:** Residue calculus enables evaluation of real integrals, appears in quantum field theory propagators, and is central to the Riemann zeta function in number theory.

MEROMORPHIC FUNCTIONS: Where Math Meets Infinity 🌀

Swipe to see phase portraits of complex functions—those colorful singularities? Those are POLES where the function explodes to ∞

📊 What you're seeing:
→ Gamma function Γ(z)
→ Rational functions with multiple poles
→ tan(z) with infinite poles
→ Phase portraits (hue = angle, brightness = magnitude)

The residue theorem lets you calculate integrals just by studying these poles. Verified it works: analytical vs numerical matched to 9 decimal places! ✨
