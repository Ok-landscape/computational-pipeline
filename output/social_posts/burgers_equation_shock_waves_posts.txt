### 2. BLUESKY (< 300 characters)

Implemented numerical solvers for Burgers' equation - a fundamental model for shock wave formation.

Key insight: Characteristics converge where ∂u₀/∂x < 0, creating discontinuities at the breaking time t_b = 1/(2π) ≈ 0.159.

Compared Godunov vs Lax-Friedrichs schemes for shock capturing.

### 3. THREADS (< 500 characters)

Ever wonder how smooth waves become sharp discontinuities?

I built a Python simulation of Burgers' equation - the simplest model showing shock formation. Starting from a sine wave u₀(x) = sin(2πx), the solution steepens until characteristics collide at t_b ≈ 0.159.

The viscous version: ∂u/∂t + u·∂u/∂x = ν·∂²u/∂x²

Adding viscosity smooths shocks - higher ν = wider transitions. Implemented Godunov scheme with exact Riemann solver for sharp shock resolution.

### 4. MASTODON (< 500 characters)

Implemented solvers for Burgers' equation demonstrating shock wave formation.

The inviscid form: ∂u/∂t + u·∂u/∂x = 0

For initial condition u₀(x) = sin(2πx), the breaking time is:
t_b = -1/min(∂u₀/∂x) = 1/(2π) ≈ 0.159

Numerical methods implemented:
- Lax-Friedrichs (diffusive, stable)
- Godunov with exact Riemann solver (sharp shocks)
- Operator splitting for viscous case

Rankine-Hugoniot shock speed: s = (u_L + u_R)/2

**Title:** Visualizing Shock Wave Formation with Burgers' Equation in Python - Here's What I Learned

**Body:**

I created a Jupyter notebook exploring Burgers' equation - a fundamental PDE that bridges the gap between simple wave equations and complex fluid dynamics.

**What's Burgers' Equation?**

Think of it as the "hello world" of nonlinear PDEs:

∂u/∂t + u·∂u/∂x = ν·∂²u/∂x²

The left side has nonlinear advection (waves moving at their own speed), the right has diffusion (smoothing). When ν = 0, you get shock waves!

**The Cool Part: Shock Formation**

Starting from a smooth sine wave u₀(x) = sin(2πx), the solution steepens because faster parts catch up to slower parts. At the "breaking time" t_b = 1/(2π) ≈ 0.159, the wave becomes infinitely steep - a shock forms.

The method of characteristics shows this beautifully: straight lines converge and cross, requiring a discontinuous solution.

**What I Implemented:**

- Lax-Friedrichs scheme (simple but diffusive)
- Godunov scheme with exact Riemann solver (sharp shocks)
- Operator splitting for viscous case
- Visualization of characteristics
- Riemann problem demonstrations (shock vs rarefaction waves)

**Key Takeaways:**

1. Nonlinearity creates shocks from smooth data
2. Viscosity smooths shocks - the limit ν → 0 recovers inviscid solutions
3. Conservation laws need special numerical treatment
4. Rankine-Hugoniot condition: shock speed s = (u_L + u_R)/2
5. Riemann problems: u_L > u_R gives shock, u_L < u_R gives rarefaction

This is essential background for computational fluid dynamics and understanding more complex systems like the Euler equations of gas dynamics.

Ever wonder how smooth ocean waves can suddenly become sharp breaking waves?

I built a Python simulation showing exactly how this happens! Starting from a gentle sine wave, nonlinear effects cause faster parts to overtake slower parts until - snap - a shock wave forms at t ≈ 0.159 seconds.

The math is beautiful: characteristic lines converge and cross, forcing discontinuities.

**Numerical Methods for Nonlinear Wave Phenomena: A Burgers' Equation Study**

Developed a comprehensive Jupyter notebook demonstrating shock wave formation and numerical solution techniques for Burgers' equation - a canonical problem in computational fluid dynamics.

**Technical Implementation:**

- Godunov scheme with exact Riemann solver for inviscid case
- Operator splitting (advection + implicit diffusion) for viscous case
- Lax-Friedrichs scheme comparison
- CFL-adaptive time stepping

**Key Results:**

For sinusoidal initial data u₀(x) = sin(2πx), the analytical breaking time t_b = 1/(2π) ≈ 0.159 matches numerical results. Demonstrated shock speed satisfying Rankine-Hugoniot condition s = (u_L + u_R)/2.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- PDE discretization and conservation law numerics
- Python scientific computing (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)
- Method of characteristics analysis
- Riemann problem resolution

This foundational work applies directly to CFD, traffic flow modeling, and gas dynamics simulations.

Shock waves from smooth beginnings

This visualization shows Burgers' equation - how a gentle sine wave transforms into a sharp discontinuity.

The physics: faster parts of the wave catch up to slower parts until they collide. At t ≈ 0.159, characteristics cross and a shock is born.

Bottom: Space-time plot and conservation check

Add viscosity to smooth things out - nature's way of preventing infinite gradients.
