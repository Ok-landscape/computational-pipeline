### Twitter/X (< 280 chars)

Just visualized the Mandelbrot set in Python!

The rule is deceptively simple: z → z² + c

Yet it creates infinite complexity. Zoom in forever and new patterns keep emerging.

### Bluesky (< 300 chars)

Exploring the Mandelbrot set: where the simple iteration z → z² + c creates infinite fractal complexity.

Used NumPy's vectorized operations to compute escape times across a 1000×800 grid. The boundary has Hausdorff dimension 2—a curve that locally fills the plane.

There's something magical about the Mandelbrot set.

The math is almost trivially simple: take z, square it, add c, repeat.

z₀ = 0
z₁ = c
z₂ = c² + c
z₃ = (c² + c)² + c
...

If this sequence stays bounded (|zₙ| ≤ 2), the point c is IN the set.

The crazy part? This simple rule generates infinite complexity. Zoom into the boundary and you find spirals, seahorses, and copies of the whole set hiding everywhere.

Built this visualization with Python + NumPy. Pure math magic.

### Mastodon (< 500 chars)

Implemented the Mandelbrot set using the escape time algorithm in Python.

The set M is defined as:
M = {c ∈ ℂ : lim sup |zₙ| ≤ 2}

where zₙ₊₁ = zₙ² + c with z₀ = 0.

Key insight: if |zₙ| > 2 for any n, the sequence escapes to ∞.

Technical notes:
- 1000×800 resolution, 100 max iterations
- Vectorized computation with NumPy masking
- Main cardioid: c = e^(iθ)/2 - e^(2iθ)/4

The boundary has Hausdorff dimension 2—infinitely complex.

**Title:** I built a Mandelbrot set visualizer in Python - here's the math behind it

**Body:**

Just finished a project exploring one of math's most beautiful objects: the Mandelbrot set.

**What is it?**

The Mandelbrot set is all complex numbers c where this sequence stays bounded:

z₀ = 0
zₙ₊₁ = zₙ² + c

That's it. Square, add c, repeat. If the sequence never blows up to infinity, c is in the set.

**The escape time algorithm:**

To visualize it, we check how many iterations it takes before |zₙ| > 2 (once it exceeds 2, it's guaranteed to escape to infinity). Color each point by its "escape time."

**Cool math facts I learned:**

1. The boundary has Hausdorff dimension 2—it's so complex it essentially fills space locally
2. The main cardioid shape comes from c = e^(iθ)/2 - e^(2iθ)/4
3. Zoom in anywhere on the boundary and you find mini copies of the entire set

**Implementation highlights:**

- Used NumPy's vectorized operations with boolean masking for speed
- 1000×800 grid with 100 max iterations for the main view
- Zoomed into "Seahorse Valley" at 500 iterations to see the fine structure

The most mind-blowing part: such a simple rule (z → z² + c) creates literally infinite complexity.

### Facebook (< 500 chars)

Ever wonder how simple rules create infinite complexity?

Meet the Mandelbrot set—one of math's most beautiful fractals.

The rule: take a number z, square it, add c, repeat. That's it.

If the sequence stays small, the point is IN the set. Otherwise, it escapes to infinity.

What blows my mind: this creates patterns that go on FOREVER. Zoom in and you keep finding new spirals, shapes, and mini copies of the whole set.

Built this visualization in Python. Math is wild.

### LinkedIn (< 1000 chars)

I recently implemented a Mandelbrot set visualizer to explore computational approaches to fractal geometry.

**The Mathematics**

The Mandelbrot set M consists of complex numbers c where the iteration zₙ₊₁ = zₙ² + c (with z₀ = 0) remains bounded. Despite this simple definition, the set exhibits extraordinary complexity—its boundary has Hausdorff dimension 2.

**Technical Implementation**

Key engineering decisions:
- Vectorized computation using NumPy with boolean masking for efficient iteration
- Escape time algorithm with threshold |z| > 2 as the divergence criterion
- 1000×800 resolution at 100 iterations for the overview, 800×800 at 500 iterations for detailed regions

**Key Insights**

This project reinforced how simple iterative rules can generate emergent complexity—a principle that extends far beyond fractals into areas like neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, and dynamical systems.

The boundary's infinite complexity also demonstrates the limits of finite computation: no matter the resolution, there's always more structure to discover.

Skills demonstrated: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, complex analysis, algorithm optimization.

The Mandelbrot set ✧

One simple rule: z → z² + c

Infinite complexity.

This fractal contains copies of itself at every scale. Zoom in forever and you'll never stop finding new patterns—spirals, seahorses, lightning bolts.

The boundary is so complex it has dimension 2. It's a curve that fills space.

Built this visualization in Python, computing escape times for a million complex numbers.

Simple rules.
Emergent beauty.
Mathematics.
