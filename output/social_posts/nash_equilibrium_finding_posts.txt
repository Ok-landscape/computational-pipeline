Implemented a Nash Equilibrium finder using support enumeration in Python. Analyzed classic games: Prisoner's Dilemma (both defect), Matching Pennies (50-50 mix), and Battle of the Sexes (3 equilibria). The math behind strategic decision-making is fascinating.

Just coded a Nash Equilibrium solver from scratch!

What I learned:
- In Prisoner's Dilemma, both players defect even though cooperation pays better
- Matching Pennies has no pure strategy solution - you must randomize 50-50
- Battle of the Sexes has THREE equilibria, creating a coordination problem

The support enumeration algorithm checks all possible strategy combinations to find stable states where no player wants to deviate.

Game theory explains so much about real-world decisions!

Built a support enumeration algorithm for finding Nash Equilibria in two-player games.

Technical details:
- Enumerates all possible supports (non-zero probability strategies)
- Solves indifference conditions: for mixed strategies, expected payoffs must be equal
- Complexity: O(2^(m+n)) for m x n strategy spaces

Tested on Prisoner's Dilemma, Matching Pennies, Battle of the Sexes, and Rock-Paper-Scissors (uniform 1/3 mixture).

Visualization shows best response correspondences intersecting at equilibria.

**Title:** I built a Nash Equilibrium solver in Python - here's what I learned about game theory

**Body:**

I've been exploring game theory and decided to implement a Nash Equilibrium finder from scratch using NumPy. Here's my breakdown:

**What is Nash Equilibrium?**

It's a stable state in a game where no player can improve their outcome by changing only their own strategy. Mathematically, if s* is the strategy profile, then for every player i:

u_i(s*_i, s*_-i) >= u_i(s_i, s*_-i) for all strategies s_i

**The Algorithm: Support Enumeration**

The algorithm works by:
1. Listing all possible "supports" (sets of strategies with non-zero probability)
2. For each support pair, solving the indifference equations
3. Verifying the solution is valid (probabilities sum to 1, non-negative)

**Results from Classic Games:**

- **Prisoner's Dilemma:** Unique equilibrium at (Defect, Defect) with payoff (1, 1) - even though (Cooperate, Cooperate) gives (3, 3)!

- **Matching Pennies:** Both players randomize 50-50, expected payoff is 0

- **Battle of the Sexes:** Three equilibria - two pure (Opera, Opera) and (Football, Football), plus one mixed

- **Rock-Paper-Scissors:** Uniform 1/3 mixture over all strategies

**Key Insight:** The conflict between individual rationality (Nash Equilibrium) and collective welfare (Pareto optimality) explains many real-world coordination failures.

Why do smart people make collectively bad decisions?

I explored this through game theory by building a Nash Equilibrium solver. The Prisoner's Dilemma shows that two rational players will both defect, even though cooperation benefits everyone more!

The notebook covers classic games and visualizes how best response curves intersect at equilibrium points. It's a beautiful mix of math, strategy, and human behavior.

Exploring Game Theory Through Code: Nash Equilibrium Finder

I recently built a Python implementation of the support enumeration algorithm for finding Nash Equilibria in strategic games.

**Technical Approach:**
- Implemented systematic enumeration of all possible mixed strategy supports
- Solved indifference conditions using NumPy's linear algebra routines
- Created visualizations of best response correspondences

**Key Findings:**
- Prisoner's Dilemma demonstrates how individual rationality can lead to collective suboptimality
- Mixed strategy equilibria (like in Matching Pennies) require players to randomize to make opponents indifferent
- Multiple equilibria in coordination games (Battle of the Sexes) create selection challenges

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Algorithm design and implementation
- NumPy/SciPy for numerical computation
- Matplotlib for data visualization
- Mathematical modeling and analysis

The complexity of support enumeration is O(2^(m+n)), making it practical for small games but highlighting the need for more efficient algorithms like Lemke-Howson for larger strategy spaces.

Nash Equilibrium: Where no player wants to change their strategy

Built a solver for classic game theory problems

What the visualization shows:
- Blue line = Player 1's best response
- Red line = Player 2's best response
- Green dots = Nash Equilibria (where lines intersect)

Prisoner's Dilemma: Both defect (bottom-left)
Matching Pennies: 50-50 randomization (center)
Battle of the Sexes: Three equilibria!

The math behind strategic decisions is everywhere - from economics to evolution to everyday choices.
