Watch heat vanish! Simulated a 100°C Gaussian pulse diffusing through a 1m rod. Width grows as √t, amplitude drops as 1/√t. The math: ∂u/∂t = α·∂²u/∂x². ~2% error vs analytical solution.

Solved the 1D heat equation using FTCS finite differences. A 100°C Gaussian pulse in a rod diffuses outward while the peak decays as 1/√t. Von Neumann stability: Fourier number r ≤ 0.5. Achieved ~2% error vs analytical solution.

Physics + Python = beautiful visualizations.

Ever wonder how heat spreads through a metal rod?

I simulated the 1D heat equation: ∂u/∂t = α·∂²u/∂x²

Started with a hot 100°C Gaussian pulse in the center, ends held at 0°C. The result? Heat spreads wider (proportional to √t) while the peak drops (proportional to 1/√t).

Key insight: the FTCS method only works when αΔt/Δx² ≤ 0.5. Violate this and your simulation explodes!

Same equation models ink diffusion, Brownian motion, and even stock prices (Black-Scholes).

Implemented 1D heat equation solver: ∂u/∂t = α·∂²u/∂x²

Details:
- FTCS finite difference scheme
- Gaussian initial condition (A=100°C, σ=0.05m)
- Dirichlet BCs: u(0,t) = u(L,t) = 0°C
- Stability: r = αΔt/Δx² = 0.4 ≤ 0.5

Compared to analytical solution for infinite domain. Max relative error ~2% (boundary effects).

Characteristic diffusion length at t=2s: L_diff = √(2αt) = 0.2m = 20% of rod length.

Heat flux analysis shows energy exits through boundaries.

TITLE: Visualizing 1D Heat Diffusion: From 100°C Pulse to Equilibrium

BODY:

**What I built:**
A Python simulation of the heat equation—the fundamental PDE describing thermal diffusion.

**The equation:**
∂u/∂t = α·∂²u/∂x²

In plain English: temperature changes proportionally to how "curved" the temperature profile is. Hot peaks cool down, cold valleys warm up.

**ELI5:**
Imagine touching a hot lighter to the middle of a metal rod. The heat equation predicts exactly how that hot spot spreads outward. Pointy temperature profiles smooth out fast; flat ones change slowly.

**Setup:**
- 1-meter rod, both ends held at 0°C
- Initial condition: Gaussian pulse (100°C peak, σ=0.05m)
- Thermal diffusivity α = 0.01 m²/s
- FTCS finite difference method

**Key Results:**
1. Pulse width grows as √t (characteristic of diffusion)
2. Peak temperature decays as 1/√t
3. Heat flux is maximum where ∂u/∂x is steepest
4. Total thermal energy decreases as heat exits through boundaries
5. ~2% max error vs analytical solution (boundary effects)

**Critical Stability Constraint:**
The Fourier number r = αΔt/Δx² must be ≤ 0.5. I used r = 0.4. Go above 0.5 and you get numerical instability!

**Why this matters:**
Same equation describes mass diffusion (Fick's law), probability spreading (Brownian motion), and financial derivatives (Black-Scholes). Master this and you understand a huge class of physical phenomena.

Ever wonder how heat spreads through metal?

I simulated exactly this! Starting with a 100°C hot spot in the center of a rod (ends at 0°C), you can watch the heat spread outward and fade away.

The cool part: the math predicts exactly how fast it spreads (width grows as √t) and how the peak drops (as 1/√t).

This same 200-year-old equation describes everything from ink diffusing in water to wildfire spreading!

**Numerical Analysis: 1D Heat Equation with FTCS Method**

Completed a comprehensive simulation of thermal diffusion, demonstrating core computational physics skills.

**Technical Implementation:**

Heat diffusion, visualized.

Started: 100°C hot spot.
Ended: almost nothing.

Watch a Gaussian pulse spread and fade on a 1-meter rod.

The physics:
∂u/∂t = α·∂²u/∂x²

Translation: heat flows from hot to cold, smoothing everything out.

The math predicts:
→ Width grows as √t
→ Peak drops as 1/√t

Same equation describes:
- Ink spreading in water
- Smells diffusing through air
- Stock price models

One equation. Infinite applications.
