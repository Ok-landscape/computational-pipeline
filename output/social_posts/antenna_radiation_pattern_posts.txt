Ever wonder how antennas "aim" their signal? It's all about radiation patterns!

Short dipole: F(θ) = |sin θ|
Half-wave: D = 1.64 (2.15 dBi)

Arrays can focus beams by combining elements.

Exploring antenna radiation patterns through computational physics.

Key insight: A 4-element broadside array at λ/2 spacing creates a focused beam perpendicular to the array axis.

Directivity increases with element count, but watch out for grating lobes when d > λ.

Why do some antennas transmit in all directions while others can pinpoint a target?

It's all about the radiation pattern! A simple dipole creates a donut-shaped pattern (F = |sin θ|), but combine multiple elements into an array and you can steer and focus the beam.

Cool finding: Going from 2 to 16 elements dramatically narrows the beam - the half-power beamwidth drops from wide to super focused.

This is the physics behind WiFi routers, 5G towers, and radar systems.

Implemented antenna radiation pattern analysis in Python.

Key equations:
- Short dipole: Fn(θ) = |sin θ|, D = 1.5 (1.76 dBi)
- Half-wave dipole: D = 1.64 (2.15 dBi)
- Array factor: AF(θ) = sin(Nψ/2) / sin(ψ/2)

Where ψ = kd·cos θ + β

Broadside arrays (β=0) radiate perpendicular to axis; end-fire arrays direct energy along the axis.

HPBW for N-element broadside ≈ 0.886λ/(Nd)

**Title:** I built an antenna radiation pattern simulator in Python - here's what I learned about how antennas "aim" their signals

**Body:**

Hey everyone! I just finished a computational physics project analyzing antenna radiation patterns and wanted to share what I learned.

**ELI5 Version:**
Imagine you're holding a flashlight. A regular bulb sends light everywhere (like an isotropic antenna), but a flashlight focuses it in one direction. Antennas work the same way - they can send radio waves in specific patterns depending on their design.

**What the code does:**

1. Calculates radiation patterns for dipole antennas
2. Models array factors for multiple-element systems
3. Computes directivity and half-power beamwidth (HPBW)

**Key findings:**

- A short dipole has pattern F(θ) = |sin θ| - it's like a donut shape
- Half-wave dipole is slightly more directional: D = 1.64 vs 1.5
- Arrays are where it gets interesting: combine 4 elements at λ/2 spacing and you get a focused beam
- More elements = narrower beam but watch out for grating lobes when spacing > λ

**The math (in plain terms):**

Directivity tells you how well an antenna focuses power:
D = 4π / ∫|Fn(θ,φ)|² sin θ dθ dφ

For a 4-element broadside array, you can get much higher directivity than a single dipole.

**Practical applications:**
- WiFi routers use multiple antennas for better coverage
- 5G uses massive MIMO arrays
- Radar systems use phased arrays to steer beams electronically

The visualization shows polar plots of different patterns plus how changing element count and spacing affects the beam.

Happy to answer questions about the implementation!

How do antennas focus their signals? I explored this with a Python simulation!

A single dipole antenna radiates in a donut shape, but combine multiple elements into an array and you can create a focused beam - this is how modern WiFi, 5G, and radar work.

Fun fact: A 16-element array creates a beam so narrow it can pinpoint specific directions while ignoring interference from other angles.

Antenna Radiation Pattern Analysis: From Theory to Implementation

I recently completed a computational analysis of antenna radiation patterns, implementing models for dipole antennas and linear arrays in Python.

**Technical Highlights:**

- Computed directivity for short dipole (D=1.5, 1.76 dBi) and half-wave dipole (D=1.64, 2.15 dBi)
- Modeled array factors: AF(θ) = sin(Nψ/2) / sin(ψ/2)
- Analyzed broadside vs end-fire configurations
- Calculated half-power beamwidth scaling with array size

**Key Engineering Insights:**

The trade-off between beamwidth and sidelobes is fundamental. Larger arrays provide higher directivity and narrower beams, but require careful element spacing to avoid grating lobes (d > λ).

Pattern multiplication principle: Total pattern = Element pattern × Array factor

**Tools Used:** NumPy for numerical computation, Matplotlib for polar plot visualization

This type of analysis is foundational for:
- 5G/6G antenna design
- Radar systems
- Satellite communications
- IoT device optimization

Visualizing how antennas shape their signals

These polar plots show radiation patterns - the "fingerprint" of how an antenna sends energy into space.

Top row: Simple dipoles create donut shapes
Middle: Arrays focus the beam
Bottom: More elements = tighter focus

The combined pattern (bottom right) shows what happens when you multiply a dipole pattern with a 4-element array.

This is the physics behind WiFi, 5G, radar, and satellite communications.
