Ever wonder why light creates patterns of bright & dark bands? Two waves + superposition = interference magic! Built a Python simulation showing how ψ_total = ψ₁ + ψ₂ creates hyperbolic fringes. The math checks out perfectly.

Simulated two-source wave interference in Python today. The superposition principle (ψ_total = ψ₁ + ψ₂) creates beautiful hyperbolic intensity patterns. Verified the fringe spacing formula Δy = λL/d against numerical results - excellent agreement. Physics is beautiful when the math works out.

Just built a wave interference simulation and I'm genuinely amazed at how elegant physics can be.

The idea is simple: two coherent sources emit waves, and where they overlap, they either amplify (constructive) or cancel (destructive).

The result? Those classic bright and dark fringe patterns you see in optics experiments.

What's cool is that the lines of equal intensity form perfect hyperbolas with the sources as foci. In the far field, they become the evenly-spaced fringes we all know from Young's double-slit experiment.

Math + Python = visual understanding.

Implemented a two-source wave interference simulation in Python/NumPy.

Key physics:
• Superposition: ψ_total(r,t) = ψ₁(r,t) + ψ₂(r,t)
• Intensity: I = 4I₀cos²(kΔr/2)
• Constructive: Δr = mλ
• Destructive: Δr = (m + ½)λ

The simulation computes path differences r₂ - r₁ across a 500×500 grid and visualizes intensity patterns. Fringe spacing at x=5 matches the theoretical prediction Δy = λL/d with < 1% error.

Contour lines of constant Δr reveal the hyperbolic geometry underlying interference.

**Title:** I built a wave interference simulation in Python - here's how the physics works

**Body:**

I've been working on understanding wave interference better, so I coded up a simulation of two-source interference in Python. Wanted to share both the physics and the implementation.

**The Core Idea**

When two waves occupy the same space, they add together (superposition principle). If they're in phase, you get constructive interference (bright spots). If they're out of phase, destructive interference (dark spots).

**The Math (in plain terms)**

- Two sources emit waves: ψ₁ = A·cos(k·r₁) and ψ₂ = A·cos(k·r₂)
- Wave number k = 2π/λ
- Total wave: ψ_total = ψ₁ + ψ₂
- Intensity: I = (ψ_total)²

The path difference Δr = r₂ - r₁ determines what happens:
- Δr = mλ → constructive (bright)
- Δr = (m + ½)λ → destructive (dark)

**What I Learned**

1. The lines of constant intensity form hyperbolas with the sources as foci
2. In the far field, these become the evenly-spaced fringes from Young's experiment
3. Fringe spacing follows Δy = λL/d (verified numerically with < 1% error)

**Implementation**

Used NumPy meshgrid for the observation plane (500×500), calculated distances to each source, summed the wave amplitudes, and squared for intensity. Matplotlib handles the visualization.

The code also uses scipy.signal.find_peaks to measure actual fringe spacing and compare to theory.

Happy to answer questions about the physics or the code!

Just finished a fun physics simulation project!

I built a model of wave interference - you know, that phenomenon that creates those beautiful patterns when light passes through two slits.

The simulation shows how two waves combine: where they sync up, you get bright spots; where they cancel, dark spots. The result is those classic stripe patterns.

What's amazing is how well the computer model matches the theoretical predictions. Math and physics working together!

Just completed a computational physics project simulating two-source wave interference.

**Technical Approach:**

The simulation implements the superposition principle for coherent wave sources, computing the resultant intensity distribution across a 2D observation plane. Key calculations include:

• Path difference mapping (Δr = r₂ - r₁)
• Intensity distribution: I = 4I₀cos²(kΔr/2)
• Far-field fringe spacing verification

**Tools & Methods:**
- Python with NumPy for numerical computation
- Matplotlib for multi-panel visualization
- SciPy signal processing for peak detection and validation

**Validation:**

The measured fringe spacing matched the theoretical prediction (Δy = λL/d) with excellent accuracy, demonstrating the reliability of the numerical approach.

**Key Insight:**

The constant-intensity contours form hyperbolic loci with sources as foci - a beautiful geometric property that simplifies to linear fringes in the far-field approximation.

This project reinforced my skills in scientific computing, numerical methods, and translating physical equations into working code.

Wave interference is pure visual poetry.

Two sources.
Same wavelength.
Different paths.

Where waves sync → bright
Where they cancel → dark

The result: these hypnotic interference patterns that reveal the wave nature of light.

Built this simulation in Python to visualize how path differences create the classic fringe patterns. The math checks out beautifully - measured spacing matches theory within 1%.

Physics really is elegant when you can see it.
