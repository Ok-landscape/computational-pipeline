Why do two connected pendulums "steal" each other's energy? 🔄

It's the beat phenomenon—energy flows back & forth at ω_beat = ω₂ - ω₁

Simulated it in Python with normal mode analysis!

Coupled oscillators reveal beautiful physics: two pendulums connected by a spring exchange energy periodically through the beat phenomenon.

Normal modes decouple the system:
• Symmetric: ω₁ = ω₀
• Antisymmetric: ω₂ = √(ω₀² + 2ω_c²)

Implemented in Python with scipy's odeint.

Ever wonder why two connected pendulums seem to "take turns" swinging?

It's called the beat phenomenon, and it's one of my favorite physics concepts!

When you displace one pendulum, the energy doesn't just stay there—it gradually transfers to the second pendulum, then back again. The math behind it involves normal modes that oscillate independently.

I built a Python simulation showing:
→ Displacement over time
→ Energy transfer between oscillators
→ Phase space trajectories
→ Normal mode decomposition

The patterns are mesmerizing!

Explored coupled oscillator dynamics with Python today.

Two pendulums (mass m, length l) connected by spring constant k follow:
ẍ₁ = -ω₀²x₁ - ω_c²(x₁ - x₂)
ẍ₂ = -ω₀²x₂ - ω_c²(x₂ - x₁)

Normal coordinates q₁ = x₁ + x₂ and q₂ = x₁ - x₂ decouple into independent harmonic oscillators with frequencies ω₁ = ω₀ and ω₂ = √(ω₀² + 2ω_c²).

Beat frequency ω_beat = ω₂ - ω₁ governs energy exchange period.

Solved with scipy.integrate.odeint, visualized with matplotlib.

**Title:** I simulated coupled oscillators in Python and finally understood the beat phenomenon

**Body:**

Ever seen two pendulums connected by a spring "take turns" swinging? That's the beat phenomenon, and I finally grokked it by coding it myself.

**The Setup**

Two identical pendulums connected by a weak spring. When you pull one back and release, something counterintuitive happens: the first pendulum gradually stops while the second one starts swinging. Then the energy flows back. It's like they're passing a ball back and forth.

**The Math (ELI5)**

The trick is finding "normal modes"—special ways the system can move where both pendulums oscillate at a single frequency:

- **Symmetric mode**: Both swing together (spring stays relaxed)
- **Antisymmetric mode**: They swing opposite (spring gets stretched)

Any motion is just these two modes superimposed. The beat comes from their frequency difference.

**What I Learned**

1. Normal mode analysis is incredibly powerful for simplifying coupled systems
2. Energy conservation is maintained throughout (good sanity check!)
3. The phase space plot creates beautiful Lissajous-like patterns

**The Code**

Used numpy and scipy's odeint to solve the ODEs, matplotlib for visualization. The notebook shows displacement, energy transfer, phase space, and normal mode decomposition.

**Interactive Notebook**

Why do two pendulums connected by a spring seem to "take turns" swinging? 🎯

It's called the beat phenomenon—one of physics' most elegant examples of energy transfer!

I built a Python simulation showing how energy flows back and forth between the oscillators. The secret? "Normal modes" that let us break the complex motion into simple, independent pieces.

This same physics explains molecular vibrations, crystal behavior, and even how noise-canceling works!

**Computational Physics: Analyzing Coupled Oscillator Dynamics**

Recently completed a numerical analysis of coupled harmonic oscillators—a foundational system in physics with applications spanning molecular spectroscopy, solid-state physics, and mechanical engineering.

**Technical Approach:**

• Formulated the equations of motion for two spring-coupled pendulums
• Applied normal mode analysis to decouple the system
• Implemented numerical integration using scipy's odeint
• Visualized dynamics including phase space trajectories and energy transfer

**Key Results:**

The simulation demonstrates the beat phenomenon: periodic energy exchange between oscillators governed by the frequency difference between symmetric (ω₁ = ω₀) and antisymmetric (ω₂ = √(ω₀² + 2ω_c²)) normal modes.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

→ Differential equation modeling
→ Numerical methods (ODE integration)
→ Scientific visualization with matplotlib
→ Physical interpretation of mathematical results

This methodology extends directly to N-body oscillator chains, forming the basis for understanding phonons in materials science.

Two pendulums, one spring, infinite beauty ✨

This is the beat phenomenon—when connected oscillators exchange energy in perfect rhythm.

Watch how:
→ Blue oscillator starts with all the energy
→ Gradually transfers to red
→ Then flows back again
→ Forever (in theory!)

The math reveals two "normal modes" that make this complex dance surprisingly simple to understand.

This same physics explains:
• How molecules vibrate
• Why crystals have specific heat properties
• Quantum entanglement in coupled systems

Built with Python, numpy, scipy, and matplotlib.
