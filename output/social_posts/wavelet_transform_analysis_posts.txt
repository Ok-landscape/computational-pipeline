Wavelets reveal what Fourier can't: WHERE and WHEN frequencies occur in signals.

Built a Morlet CWT to analyze a chirp + transient burst. The scalogram shows perfect time-frequency localization.

Implemented Continuous Wavelet Transform analysis in Python using the Morlet wavelet.

Unlike FFT's fixed resolution, wavelets provide adaptive multi-resolution: better time resolution at high frequencies, better frequency resolution at low frequencies.

The Heisenberg principle applies: Δt·Δf ≥ 1/4π

Ever wonder how scientists analyze signals that change frequency over time?

The wavelet transform is the answer. Unlike regular Fourier analysis, wavelets tell you WHEN different frequencies occur, not just which ones exist.

I implemented the Morlet wavelet CWT to analyze a chirp signal (10→100 Hz sweep) with a hidden burst at t=1s. The scalogram beautifully captures both the gradual sweep AND the transient event.

This is the same math behind JPEG 2000 compression, EEG analysis, and earthquake detection.

New computational notebook: Continuous Wavelet Transform analysis with Morlet wavelet

Key implementation details:
- Morlet: ψ(t) = π^(-1/4) · exp(iω₀t) · exp(-t²/2)
- Scale-frequency relation: f = ω₀/(2πaΔt)
- Convolution-based CWT with proper normalization

Test signal: linear chirp (10-100 Hz) + Gaussian-windowed 50 Hz burst

Results show excellent time-frequency localization compared to STFT. The uncertainty principle trade-off (Δt·Δf ≥ 1/4π) is clearly visible in the scalogram.

**Title:** Implemented Continuous Wavelet Transform from scratch - here's what I learned about time-frequency analysis

**Body:**

I just finished a notebook implementing the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) using the Morlet wavelet, and wanted to share some insights.

**The Problem with Fourier:**
Regular FFT tells you which frequencies exist in a signal, but not when they occur. For non-stationary signals (where frequency changes over time), you need something better.

**Enter Wavelets:**
The CWT uses a "mother wavelet" that gets stretched (scaled) and shifted (translated) across your signal:

W(a,b) = (1/√a) · ∫ f(t) · ψ*((t-b)/a) dt

- a = scale (inversely related to frequency)
- b = translation (time position)
- ψ = mother wavelet

**My Test Signal:**
- Linear chirp: frequency sweeps from 10 Hz to 100 Hz
- Transient burst: 50 Hz Gaussian-windowed pulse at t=1.0s
- Added noise for realism

**Key Insight - The Uncertainty Principle:**
You literally cannot have perfect time AND frequency resolution simultaneously. Δt·Δf ≥ 1/4π

At low frequencies (large scales): great frequency resolution, poor time resolution
At high frequencies (small scales): great time resolution, poor frequency resolution

This is why the scalogram shows wider "blobs" at low frequencies and narrower ones at high frequencies.

**Why Morlet?**
ψ(t) = π^(-1/4) · exp(iω₀t) · exp(-t²/2)

It's a complex sinusoid modulated by a Gaussian - provides optimal joint time-frequency localization.

**Practical Applications:**
- Seismic analysis (detecting P and S waves)
- Medical: ECG/EEG pattern detection
- JPEG 2000 uses discrete wavelet transform
- Financial time series anomaly detection

Just built something cool: a wavelet transform analyzer that reveals hidden patterns in signals!

Unlike regular frequency analysis, wavelets show you exactly WHEN different frequencies occur. Think of it like a musical score vs just knowing which notes are in a song.

My test caught both a smoothly rising tone (10→100 Hz chirp) AND a brief 50 Hz pulse hidden in noise.

This is the same math used in medical scanners, earthquake detectors, and image compression!

Exploring Time-Frequency Analysis with Continuous Wavelet Transforms

I recently completed a computational analysis implementing the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) using the Morlet wavelet for signal processing applications.

**Technical Approach:**
- Implemented CWT via convolution with scaled/translated Morlet wavelets
- Analyzed a test signal containing linear frequency modulation (10-100 Hz chirp) and a transient burst
- Compared results against Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)

**Key Findings:**
The wavelet approach provides adaptive multi-resolution analysis that outperforms fixed-window STFT for non-stationary signals. The scalogram successfully captured both gradual frequency evolution and localized transient events.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Signal processing algorithm implementation
- NumPy/SciPy for scientific computing
- Mathematical modeling (convolution, complex analysis)
- Data visualization with Matplotlib

**Applications:**
This methodology applies to biomedical signal analysis (ECG/EEG), financial time series, seismic data processing, and audio analysis.

Wavelets: The time-frequency microscope

This scalogram reveals a signal's hidden structure:

→ The diagonal line = frequency sweeping from 10 to 100 Hz
→ The bright spot at t=1s = a brief 50 Hz burst
→ Colors = signal energy (brighter = stronger)

Why wavelets matter:
Regular Fourier analysis tells you WHAT frequencies exist.
Wavelets tell you WHERE and WHEN.

Same math powers:
- Medical brain scans
- Earthquake detection
- JPEG 2000 compression
- Music analysis

The uncertainty principle limits resolution: you can't perfectly know both time AND frequency (Δt·Δf ≥ 1/4π)
