How do mathematicians detect "holes" in shapes? The fundamental group counts loops that can't be shrunk to a point.

Circle: π₁ = ℤ (count the winds)
Torus: π₁ = ℤ × ℤ

The fundamental group π₁(X) is algebraic topology's first invariant. It classifies loops up to continuous deformation.

Key insight: Different spaces have different fundamental groups.
- Sphere: trivial (all loops shrink)
- Circle: ℤ (winding number)
- Torus: ℤ × ℤ

Ever wonder how mathematicians tell shapes apart?

The fundamental group is one answer. It looks at all possible loops you can draw on a surface and asks: can this loop be continuously shrunk to a point?

On a sphere? Yes, always.
On a donut (torus)? Depends on the loop!

The torus has TWO independent types of loops that can't shrink - one around the hole, one around the tube. That's why π₁(torus) = ℤ × ℤ.

Math is beautiful when you visualize it.

Exploring the fundamental group π₁(X, x₀) in algebraic topology.

The key idea: loops based at x₀ form a group under concatenation, with homotopy equivalence as the relation.

Results visualized:
- Torus generators: π₁(T²) ≅ ℤ × ℤ
- Winding numbers: π₁(ℝ² \ {0}) ≅ ℤ
- Figure-8: π₁ ≅ F₂ (free group, non-abelian!)

The Seifert-van Kampen theorem lets us compute π₁ for complex spaces from simpler pieces.

Title: Visualizing the Fundamental Group - How Algebraic Topology Detects "Holes" in Shapes

Body:

I created a Jupyter notebook exploring the fundamental group π₁(X), one of the most important concepts in algebraic topology.

**What is the fundamental group?**

The fundamental group captures information about "holes" in a space by studying loops. Two loops are considered equivalent if one can be continuously deformed into the other (a "homotopy").

**Key examples:**

| Space | π₁ | Why? |
|-------|-----|------|
| ℝⁿ (Euclidean space) | trivial | All loops can contract |
| S¹ (circle) | ℤ | Loops counted by winding number |
| S² (sphere) | trivial | Any loop can shrink |
| Torus T² | ℤ × ℤ | Two independent generators |
| Figure-8 | F₂ | Free group on 2 generators |

**The cool part:** The figure-8 has a *non-abelian* fundamental group! This means the order you traverse loops matters: going around loop a then loop b is NOT the same as b then a.

**What the notebook covers:**
1. Theoretical foundations (paths, homotopy, group structure)
2. Visualization of torus generators
3. Winding number computation
4. Path homotopy animation
5. The non-abelian figure-8 example

The visualizations really help build intuition for why different spaces have different fundamental groups.

How do mathematicians tell a donut from a sphere? They look at loops!

The "fundamental group" counts different types of loops you can draw on a shape. On a sphere, every loop can shrink to a point. On a donut? Some loops get "stuck" around the hole.

I made some cool visualizations showing how this works - including why the figure-8 shape has surprising properties where the order you trace loops actually matters!

Exploring Algebraic Topology: The Fundamental Group

I've been working on computational approaches to visualizing abstract mathematical concepts. My latest project: an interactive Jupyter notebook on the fundamental group π₁(X).

The fundamental group is a cornerstone of algebraic topology that assigns an algebraic structure (a group) to a topological space. It captures essential information about the "connectivity" of a space by classifying loops up to continuous deformation.

Technical highlights:
- Implemented winding number computation using discrete path integration
- Visualized the two generators of π₁(Torus) ≅ ℤ × ℤ on a 3D parametric surface
- Demonstrated path homotopy through interpolated curve families
- Illustrated the non-abelian structure of π₁(Figure-8) ≅ F₂

Tools: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib (3D projections)

This project demonstrates how computational tools can make abstract mathematical concepts accessible and intuitive. The combination of rigorous theory with interactive visualization is a powerful approach for both learning and teaching.

The Fundamental Group: Where Algebra Meets Topology

This visualization shows how mathematicians classify loops on surfaces.

On a torus (donut shape), there are TWO independent types of loops:
- One around the hole (blue)
- One around the tube (red)

Neither can be shrunk to a point.
Neither can be deformed into the other.

That's why the fundamental group of a torus is ℤ × ℤ - two copies of the integers, one for each type of loop.

Mathematics reveals hidden structure in shapes we see every day.
