Symmetric polynomials: math that doesn't care about order!

e₁(a,b,c) = a+b+c
e₂(a,b,c) = ab+ac+bc
e₃(a,b,c) = abc

Swap variables any way you like - the result stays the same. Fundamental to Galois theory & why some equations can't be solved.

Explored symmetric polynomials today - functions that remain unchanged under any permutation of variables.

Key insight: Every symmetric polynomial can be written using just the elementary ones (e₁, e₂, ..., eₙ).

This is why polynomial coefficients encode root information via Vieta's formulas.

Just built a computational notebook on symmetric polynomials and I'm kind of obsessed with how elegant they are.

The idea: a polynomial f(x,y,z) is symmetric if swapping any variables leaves it unchanged.

The cool part? There are special "elementary" symmetric polynomials e₁, e₂, ... eₙ that generate ALL symmetric polynomials. It's like having a universal basis.

And they connect directly to polynomial roots through Vieta's formulas: coefficients = elementary symmetric polynomials of the roots!

Implemented symmetric polynomials in Python and verified several classical results:

- Elementary symmetric polynomials e_k (sums over k-subset products)
- Power sum polynomials p_k = ∑xᵢᵏ
- Newton's identities connecting e_k and p_k
- Vieta's formulas: polynomial coefficients are signed e_k of roots

The fundamental theorem states {e₁,...,eₙ} generates the entire ring of symmetric polynomials. Verified numerically that e_k is invariant under all n! permutations.

Applications span Galois theory, representation theory, and combinatorics.

**Title:** Implementing Symmetric Polynomials in Python - From Theory to Visualization

**Body:**

I built an interactive Jupyter notebook exploring symmetric polynomials - polynomials that stay the same when you swap their variables around.

**What are symmetric polynomials?**

A polynomial f(x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ) is symmetric if permuting the variables doesn't change it. For example, x₁ + x₂ + x₃ is symmetric, but x₁ + 2x₂ is not.

**The elementary symmetric polynomials:**

- e₀ = 1
- e₁ = x₁ + x₂ + ... + xₙ (sum of all variables)
- e₂ = sum of all products of 2 distinct variables
- e₃ = sum of all products of 3 distinct variables
- eₙ = x₁ · x₂ · ... · xₙ (product of all)

**Why do they matter?**

1. **Fundamental Theorem:** Every symmetric polynomial can be written using just e₁, e₂, ..., eₙ
2. **Vieta's Formulas:** The coefficients of a polynomial are (up to sign) the elementary symmetric polynomials of its roots
3. **Galois Theory:** These polynomials are key to understanding which polynomial equations can be solved by radicals

**What I implemented:**

- Functions to compute e_k and power sum polynomials p_k
- Verification of Newton's identities (relating e_k and p_k)
- Vieta's formulas demonstration
- Symmetry verification across all permutations
- Visualizations of polynomial behavior

The code uses only numpy and matplotlib. Each function is documented with examples.

Ever wonder why a polynomial's coefficients "know" about its roots?

The answer is symmetric polynomials - special functions that don't change when you swap variables around.

Vieta discovered that if r₁, r₂, r₃ are roots of x³ + ax² + bx + c, then:
- a = -(r₁ + r₂ + r₃)
- b = r₁r₂ + r₁r₃ + r₂r₃
- c = -r₁r₂r₃

The coefficients ARE the symmetric polynomials of the roots!

New computational notebook: Symmetric Polynomials - Theory and Implementation

I developed an interactive Python notebook exploring one of algebra's most elegant structures: symmetric polynomials.

Key implementations:
- Elementary symmetric polynomials e_k using combinatorial summation
- Power sum symmetric polynomials p_k = x₁ᵏ + x₂ᵏ + ... + xₙᵏ
- Complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials h_k
- Numerical verification of Newton's identities
- Vieta's formulas connecting polynomial coefficients to root structure

Technical approach:
- Leveraged Python's itertools for efficient k-subset enumeration
- Verified invariance under all n! permutations
- Created visualizations showing polynomial behavior and term counts

These polynomials are foundational to:
- Galois theory (solvability of equations)
- Representation theory (symmetric group characters)
- Algebraic combinatorics
- Invariant theory

The notebook demonstrates clean, documented code with mathematical verification at each step.

Symmetric Polynomials

Polynomials that don't care about order.

e₁ = x + y + z
e₂ = xy + xz + yz
e₃ = xyz

Swap x, y, z however you want.
The answer stays the same.

These simple functions unlock:
- Why some equations can't be solved
- How coefficients encode roots
- The deep structure of algebra

Newton, Vieta, and Galois all studied these.
Now computed in Python.

Mathematics is beautiful.
