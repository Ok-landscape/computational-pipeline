Symmetric polynomials: polynomials unchanged by swapping variables!

e₁(x,y,z) = x+y+z
e₂(x,y,z) = xy+xz+yz
e₃(x,y,z) = xyz

Ever wonder why polynomial coefficients and roots are so deeply connected?

Symmetric polynomials are the answer! These are polynomials that don't change when you permute their variables.

For example: x+y+z stays the same whether you swap x and y, or any other pair.

The "elementary" symmetric polynomials form a complete basis - you can build ANY symmetric polynomial from them.

This is the secret behind Vieta's formulas connecting roots to coefficients!

Implemented and verified symmetric polynomials in Python:

- Elementary symmetric polynomials eₖ = sum of all k-fold products
- Power sum polynomials pₖ = x₁ᵏ + x₂ᵏ + ... + xₙᵏ
- Complete homogeneous polynomials hₖ

Verified Newton's identities: k·eₖ = Σᵢ₌₁ᵏ (-1)ⁱ⁻¹ eₖ₋ᵢ pᵢ

Also demonstrated Vieta's formulas computationally - coefficients of a polynomial ARE the elementary symmetric polynomials of its roots (up to sign).

Title: Implementing Symmetric Polynomials in Python - Verifying Newton's Identities and Vieta's Formulas

Body:

I created a Jupyter notebook exploring symmetric polynomials - polynomials that remain unchanged when you permute their variables.

**What are symmetric polynomials?**

A polynomial f(x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ) is symmetric if swapping any variables doesn't change it. For example, x+y+z or xy+xz+yz.

**The elementary symmetric polynomials** are the building blocks:
- e₀ = 1
- e₁ = x₁ + x₂ + ... + xₙ (sum of variables)
- e₂ = sum of all pairs multiplied together
- eₙ = x₁·x₂·...·xₙ (product of all)

**Why do they matter?**

1. **Vieta's Formulas**: The coefficients of a polynomial ARE the elementary symmetric polynomials of its roots! If r₁, r₂, r₃ are roots of x³ + ax² + bx + c = 0, then:
   - a = -(r₁+r₂+r₃) = -e₁
   - b = r₁r₂+r₁r₃+r₂r₃ = e₂
   - c = -r₁r₂r₃ = -e₃

2. **Fundamental Theorem**: Every symmetric polynomial can be written as a polynomial in e₁, e₂, ..., eₙ

3. **Newton's Identities**: Connect elementary symmetric polynomials to power sums (x₁ᵏ + x₂ᵏ + ...)

The notebook includes Python implementations, numerical verification of all identities, and visualizations.

Here's a cool math fact: the coefficients of a polynomial are secretly telling you about its roots!

If a polynomial has roots 1, 2, and 3, you can find the coefficients just by adding and multiplying those numbers in specific ways. This magic is called "Vieta's formulas" and it comes from symmetric polynomials.

I made an interactive notebook exploring this beautiful connection between algebra and combinatorics.

Exploring Symmetric Polynomials: Where Algebra Meets Computation

I recently developed a computational notebook investigating symmetric polynomials - mathematical objects that remain invariant under variable permutation.

Key implementations:
- Elementary symmetric polynomials (eₖ) using combinatorial enumeration
- Power sum polynomials (pₖ)
- Complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials (hₖ)

Verified mathematical identities:
- Newton's identities connecting eₖ and pₖ
- Vieta's formulas relating polynomial coefficients to roots
- Generating function identities
- Symmetry properties under all n! permutations

These polynomials are foundational in:
- Galois theory (polynomial solvability)
- Representation theory (symmetric group characters)
- Algebraic combinatorics
- Invariant theory

Technical stack: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, itertools for combinatorial generation.

The notebook demonstrates rigorous numerical verification of theoretical results - an approach I find valuable for building intuition alongside formal proofs.

The secret life of polynomial coefficients

Those numbers in front of x², x, and the constant term? They're not random - they encode information about the polynomial's roots through "symmetric polynomials."

- Computational verification in Python

This is why algebra is so interconnected - one concept reveals another.
